	<h2>NOTE BY THE PUBLISHER</h2>
	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Very</span> few of the twenty fairy tales included in this
	volume have been presented before in an English
	dress; this will doubtless enhance their value in the eyes
	of the young folk, for whom, principally, they are intended.
	It is hoped that older readers will find some additional
	interest in tracing throughout the many evidences of kinship
	between these stories and those of more pronounced
	Eastern origin.</p>

	<p>The translation has been carefully revised by a well-known
	writer, who has interfered as little as possible with
	the original text, except in those instances where slight
	alterations were necessary.</p>

	<p>The illustrations speak for themselves, and are what
	might have been expected from the artist who designed
	those for the &#8220;Lullabies of Many Lands,&#8221; issued last
	Christmas.</p>

			THE TWO BROTHERS</h3>
		<p class="first_paragraph" ><span class="first_word">Once</span> upon a
		time there
		were two brothers
		whose father had left
		them but a small
		fortune. The eldest
		grew very rich, but at
		the same time cruel and
		wicked, whereas there
		was nowhere a more
		honest or kinder man
		than the younger. But
		he remained poor,
		and had many children,
		so that at times
		they could scarcely
		get bread to eat. At
		last, one day there
		was not even this
		in the house, so he
		went to his rich
		brother and asked
		<a class="pagenum" id="page4" title="4">&nbsp;</a>him for a loaf of bread. Waste of time! His rich brother
		only called him beggar and vagabond, and slammed the door
		in his face.</p>

		<p>The poor fellow, after this brutal reception, did not know
		which way to turn. Hungry, scantily clad, shivering with
		cold, his legs could scarcely carry him along. He had not
		the heart to go home, with nothing for the children, so he
		went towards the mountain forest. But all he found there
		were some wild pears that had fallen to the ground. He had
		to content himself with eating these, though they set his
		teeth on edge. But what was he to do to warm himself, for
		the east wind with its chill blast pierced him through and
		through. &#8220;Where shall I go?&#8221; he said; &#8220;what will become
		of us in the cottage? There is neither food nor fire, and
		my brother has driven me from his door.&#8221; It was just then
		he remembered having heard that the top of the mountain in
		front of him was made of crystal, and had a fire for ever
		burning upon it. &#8220;I will try and find it,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
		then I may be able to warm myself a little.&#8221; So he went
		on climbing higher and higher till he reached the top, when
		he was startled to see twelve strange beings sitting round
		a huge fire. He stopped for a moment, but then said to
		himself, &#8220;What have I to lose? Why should I fear? God
		is with me. Courage!&#8221;</p>

		<p>So he advanced towards the fire, and bowing respectfully,
		said: &#8220;Good people, take pity on my distress. I am very
		poor, no one cares for me, I have not even a fire in my
		cottage; will you let me warm myself at yours?&#8221; They all
		looked kindly at him, and one of them said: &#8220;My son,
		come sit down with us and warm yourself.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

		<div class="image"><a class="pagenum disguise" id="page5" title="5">&nbsp;</a>
			<a href="images/illo-02.png"><img src="images/illo-02-th.png" width="307" height="484" alt="A young man stoops while a crowd of people put a sack on his back." /></a>
			<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6">&nbsp;</a>[Blank Page] -->
		</div>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7">&nbsp;</a>So he sat down, and felt warm directly he was near
		them. But he dared not speak while they were silent.
		What astonished him most was that they changed seats
		one after another, and in such a way that each one passed
		round the fire and came back to his own place. When
		he drew near the fire an old man with long white beard
		and bald head arose from the flames and spoke to him
		thus:</p>

		<p>&#8220;Man, waste not thy life here; return to thy cottage,
		work, and live honestly. Take as many embers as thou
		wilt, we have more than we need.&#8221;</p>

		<p>And having said this he disappeared. Then the twelve
		filled a large sack with embers, and, putting it on the poor
		man&#8217;s shoulders, advised him to hasten home.</p>

		<p>Humbly thanking them, he set off. As he went he
		wondered why the embers did not feel hot, and why they
		should weigh no more than a sack of paper. He was
		thankful that he should be able to have a fire, but imagine
		his astonishment when on arriving home he found the sack
		to contain as many gold pieces as there had been embers;
		he almost went out of his mind with joy at the possession
		of so much money. With all his heart he thanked those
		who had been so ready to help him in his need.</p>

		<p>He was now rich, and rejoiced to be able to provide for
		his family. Being curious to find out how many gold pieces
		there were, and not knowing how to count, he sent his
		wife to his rich brother for the loan of a quart measure.</p>

		<p>This time the brother was in a better temper, so he
		lent what was asked of him, but said mockingly, &#8220;What can
		such beggars as you have to measure?&#8221;</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8">&nbsp;</a>The wife replied, &#8220;Our neighbour owes us some wheat;
		we want to be sure he returns us the right quantity.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The rich brother was puzzled, and suspecting something
		he, unknown to his sister-in-law, put some grease inside the
		measure. The trick succeeded, for on getting it back he
		found a piece of gold sticking to it. Filled with astonishment,
		he could only suppose his brother had joined a band
		of robbers: so he hurried to his brother&#8217;s cottage, and threatened
		to bring him before the Justice of the Peace if he did
		not confess where the gold came from. The poor man was
		troubled, and, dreading to offend his brother, told the story
		of his journey to the Crystal Mountain.</p>

		<p>Now the elder brother had plenty of money for himself,
		yet he was envious of the brother&#8217;s good fortune, and became
		greatly displeased when he found that his brother
		won every one&#8217;s esteem by the good use he made of his
		wealth. At last he determined to visit the Crystal Mountain
		himself.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I may meet with as good luck as my brother,&#8221; said he
		to himself.</p>

		<p>Upon reaching the Crystal Mountain he found the twelve
		seated round the fire as before, and thus addressed them:</p>

		<p>&#8220;I beg of you, good people, to let me warm myself, for
		it is bitterly cold, and I am poor and homeless.&#8221;</p>

		<p>But one of them replied, &#8220;My son, the hour of thy birth
		was favourable; thou art rich, but a miser; thou art wicked,
		for thou hast dared to lie to us. Well dost thou deserve thy
		punishment.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Amazed and terrified he stood silent, not daring to speak.
		Meanwhile the twelve changed places one after another, each
		<a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9">&nbsp;</a>at last returning to his own seat. Then from the midst
		of the flames arose the white-bearded old man and spoke
		thus sternly to the rich man:</p>

		<p>&#8220;Woe unto the wilful! Thy brother is virtuous, therefore
		have I blessed him. As for thee, thou art wicked, and so
		shalt not escape our vengeance.&#8221;</p>

		<p>At these words the twelve arose. The first seized the
		unfortunate man, struck him, and passed him on to the
		second; the second also struck him and passed him on to the
		third; and so did they all in their turn, until he was given up
		to the old man, who disappeared with him into the fire.</p>

		<p>Days, weeks, months went by, but the rich man never
		returned, and none knew what had become of him. I think,
		between you and me, the younger brother had his suspicions
		but he very wisely kept them to himself.</p>

			TIME AND THE KINGS OF THE ELEMENTS</h3>

			<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents" title="Return to Contents">ToC</a></p>

			<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">There</span> was once a married pair who loved each other
			tenderly. The husband would not have given up his
			wife for all the riches in the world, while her first thought
			was how best to please him. So they were very happy, and
			lived like two grains in one ear of corn.</p>

			<p>One day while working in the fields, a great longing came
			over him to see her: so without waiting for the hour of sunset
			he ran home. Alas! she was not there. He looked high
			and low, he ran here, there, and everywhere, he wept, he
			called to her; in vain! his dear wife was not to be found.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11">&nbsp;</a>So heartbroken was he that he no longer cared to live.
			He could think of nothing but the loss of his dear wife and
			how to find her again. At last he determined to travel all
			over the world in search of her. So he began to walk straight
			on, trusting God to direct his steps. Sad and thoughtful,
			he wandered for many days, until he reached a cottage close
			by the shores of a large lake. Here he stopped, hoping to
			find out news. On entering the cottage he was met by a
			woman, who tried to prevent him entering.</p>

			<p>&#8220;What do you want here, unlucky wretch?&#8221; said she.
			&#8220;If my husband sees you, he will kill you instantly.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Who is your husband then?&#8221; asked the traveller.</p>

			<p>&#8220;What! you do not know him? My husband is the
			Water-King; everything under water obeys him. Depart
			quickly, for if he finds you here he will certainly devour
			you.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Perhaps after all he would take pity on me. But hide me
			somewhere, for I am worn and weary, and without shelter
			for the night.&#8221;</p>

			<p>So the Water-Queen was persuaded, and hid him behind
			the stove. Almost immediately after the Water-King entered.
			He had barely crossed the threshold when he called out,
			&#8220;Wife, I smell human flesh; give it me quickly, for I am
			hungry.&#8221; She dared not disobey him, and so she had to tell
			him of the traveller&#8217;s hiding-place. The poor man became
			terribly frightened, and trembled in every limb, and began to
			stammer out excuses.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I assure you I have done no harm. I came here in
			search of news of my poor wife. Oh, do help me to find
			her; I cannot live without her.&#8221;</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Well,&#8221; replied the Water-King, &#8220;as you love your
			wife so tenderly I will forgive you for coming here, but
			I cannot help you to find her, for I do not know where
			she is. Yet I remember seeing two ducks on the lake
			yesterday, perchance she is one of them. But I should
			advise you to ask my brother the Fire-King; he may be
			able to tell you more.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Happy to have escaped so easily, he thanked the Water-King
			and set out to find the Fire-King. But the latter
			was unable to help him, and could only advise him to
			consult his other brother, the Air-King. But the Air-King,
			though he had travelled all over the earth, could only say
			he thought he had seen a woman at the foot of the Crystal
			Mountain.</p>

			<p>But the traveller was cheered at the news, and went to
			seek his wife at the foot of the Crystal Mountain, which was
			close to their cottage. On reaching it he began at once to
			climb the mountain by making his way up the bed of the
			torrent that came rushing down there. Several ducks that
			were in the pools near the waterfall called out, &#8220;My good
			man, don&#8217;t go up there; you&#8217;ll be killed.&#8221;</p>

			<p>But he walked fearlessly on till he came to some thatched
			cottages, at the largest of which he stopped. Here a crowd
			of wizards and witches surrounded him, screaming at the
			top of their voices, &#8220;What are you looking for?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;My wife,&#8221; said he.</p>

			<p>&#8220;She is here,&#8221; they cried, &#8220;but you cannot take her away
			unless you recognise her among two hundred women all
			exactly like her.&#8221;</p>

			<div class="image"><a class="pagenum disguise" id="page13" title="13">&nbsp;</a>

				<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14">&nbsp;</a>[Blank Page] -->
			</div>

			<p>&#8220;What! Not know my own wife? Why, here she is,&#8221;  <!-- Original location of pages 13 & 14 -->
			<a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15">&nbsp;</a>said he, as he clasped her in his arms. And she, delighted
			to be with him again, kissed him fondly. Then she
			whispered:</p>

			<p>&#8220;Dearest, though you knew me to-day I doubt whether
			you will to-morrow, for there will be so many of us all alike.
			Now I will tell you what to do. At nightfall go to the top
			of the Crystal Mountain, where live the King of Time and
			his court. Ask him how you may know me. If you are good
			and honest he will help you; if not, he will devour you whole
			at one mouthful.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I will do what you advise, dear one,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;but
			tell me, why did you leave me so suddenly? If you only
			knew what I have suffered! I have sought you all over the
			world.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I did not leave you willingly,&#8221; said she. &#8220;A countryman
			asked me to come and look at the mountain torrent.
			When we got there he sprinkled some water over himself, and
			at once I saw wings growing out of his shoulders, and he
			soon changed his shape entirely into that of a drake; and I
			too became a duck at the same time, and whether I would
			or no I was obliged to follow him. Here I was allowed to
			resume my own form; and now there is but the one difficulty
			of being recognised by you.&#8221;</p>

			<p>So they parted, she to join the other women, he to
			continue his way to the Crystal Mountain. At the top he
			found twelve strange beings sitting round a large fire: they
			were the attendants of the King of Time. He saluted them
			respectfully.</p>

			<p>&#8220;What dost thou want?&#8221; said they.</p>

			<p>&#8220;I have lost my dear wife. Can you tell me how to
			<a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16">&nbsp;</a>recognise her among two hundred other women all exactly
			alike?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said they, &#8220;but perhaps our King can.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Then arose from the midst of the flames an old man with
			bald head and long white beard, who, on hearing his request,
			replied: &#8220;Though all these women be exactly alike, thy wife
			will have a black thread in the shoe of her right foot.&#8221;</p>

			<p>So saying he vanished, and the traveller, thanking the
			twelve, descended the mountain.</p>

			<p>Sure it is that without the black thread he would never
			have recognised her. And though the Magician tried to
			hide her, the spell was broken; and the two returned rejoicing
			to their home, where they lived happily ever after.</p>

			THE TWELVE MONTHS</h3>

		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents" title="Return to Contents">ToC</a></p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">There</span> was once a widow who had two daughters, Helen,
		her own child by her dead husband, and Marouckla,
		his daughter by his first wife. She loved Helen, but hated
		<a class="pagenum" id="page18" title="18">&nbsp;</a>the poor orphan, because she was far prettier than her own
		daughter. Marouckla did not think about her good looks,
		and could not understand why her stepmother should be
		angry at the sight of her. The hardest work fell to her share;
		she cleaned out the rooms, cooked, washed, sewed, spun,
		wove, brought in the hay, milked the cow, and all this without
		any help. Helen, meanwhile, did nothing but dress
		herself in her best clothes and go to one amusement after
		another. But Marouckla never complained; she bore the
		scoldings and bad temper of mother and sister with a smile
		on her lips, and the patience of a lamb. But this angelic
		behaviour did not soften them. They became even more
		tyrannical and grumpy, for Marouckla grew daily more
		beautiful, while Helen&#8217;s ugliness increased. So the stepmother
		determined to get rid of Marouckla, for she knew that
		while she remained her own daughter would have no suitors.
		Hunger, every kind of privation, abuse, every means was used
		to make the girl&#8217;s life miserable. The most wicked of men
		could not have been more mercilessly cruel than these two
		vixens. But in spite of it all Marouckla grew ever sweeter
		and more charming.</p>

		<p>One day in the middle of winter Helen wanted some
		wood-violets.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; cried she to Marouckla; &#8220;you must go up the
		mountain and find me some violets, I want some to put in
		my gown; they must be fresh and sweet-scented&#8212;do you
		hear?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;But, my dear sister, who ever heard of violets blooming
		in the snow?&#8221; said the poor orphan.</p>

		<p>&#8220;You wretched creature! Do you dare to disobey me?&#8221;
		<a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19">&nbsp;</a>said Helen. &#8220;Not another word; off with you. If you do
		not bring me some violets from the mountain forest, I will
		kill you.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The stepmother also added her threats to those of Helen,
		and with vigorous blows they pushed Marouckla outside
		and shut the door upon her. The weeping girl made her
		way to the mountain. The snow lay deep, and there was no
		trace of any human being. Long she wandered hither and
		thither, and lost herself in the wood. She was hungry, and
		shivered with cold, and prayed to die. Suddenly she saw a
		light in the distance, and climbed towards it, till she reached
		the top of the mountain. Upon the highest peak burnt a large
		fire, surrounded by twelve blocks of stone, on which sat twelve
		strange beings. Of these the first three had white hair, three
		were not quite so old, three were young and handsome, and
		the rest still younger.</p>

		<p>There they all sate silently looking at the fire. They were
		the twelve months of the year. The great Setchène (January)
		was placed higher than the others; his hair and moustache
		were white as snow, and in his hand he held a wand. At
		first Marouckla was afraid, but after a while her courage
		returned, and drawing near she said:</p>

		<p>&#8220;Men of God, may I warm myself at your fire? I am
		chilled by the winter cold.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The great Setchène raised his head and answered:</p>

		<p>&#8220;What brings thee here, my daughter? What dost thou
		seek?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;I am looking for violets,&#8221; replied the maiden.</p>

		<p>&#8220;This is not the season for violets; dost thou not see
		the snow everywhere?&#8221; said Setchène.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;I know well, but my sister Helen and my stepmother
		have ordered me to bring them violets from your mountain:
		if I return without them they will kill me. I pray you, good
		shepherds, tell me where they may be found?&#8221;</p>

		<p>Here the great Setchène arose and went over to the
		youngest of the months, and placing his wand in his hand,
		said:</p>

		<p>&#8220;Brother Brezène (March), do thou take the highest
		place.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Brezène obeyed, at the same time waving his wand over
		the fire. Immediately the flames rose towards the sky, the
		snow began to melt and the trees and shrubs to bud; the
		grass became green, and from between its blades peeped the
		pale primrose. It was Spring, and the meadows were blue
		with violets.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Gather them quickly, Marouckla,&#8221; said Brezène.</p>

		<p>Joyfully she hastened to pick the flowers, and having soon
		a large bunch she thanked them and ran home. Helen and
		the stepmother were amazed at the sight of the flowers, the
		scent of which filled the house.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Where did you find them?&#8221; asked Helen.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Under the trees on the mountain slope,&#8221; said Marouckla.</p>

		<p>Helen kept the flowers for herself and her mother; she
		did not even thank her step-sister for the trouble she had
		taken. The next day she desired Marouckla to fetch her
		strawberries.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Run,&#8221; said she, &#8220;and fetch me strawberries from the
		mountain: they must be very sweet and ripe.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;But who ever heard of strawberries ripening in the
		snow?&#8221; exclaimed Marouckla.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Hold your tongue, worm; don&#8217;t answer me; if I don&#8217;t
		have my strawberries I will kill you.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Then the stepmother pushed her into the yard and bolted
		the door. The unhappy girl made her way towards the mountain
		and to the large fire round which sat the twelve months.
		The great Setchène occupied the highest place.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Men of God, may I warm myself at your fire? The
		winter cold chills me,&#8221; said she, drawing near.</p>

		<p>The great Setchène raised his head and asked:</p>

		<p>&#8220;Why comest thou here? What dost thou seek?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;I am looking for strawberries,&#8221; said she.</p>

		<p>&#8220;We are in the midst of winter,&#8221; replied Setchène; &#8220;strawberries
		do not grow in the snow.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said the girl sadly, &#8220;but my sister and stepmother
		have ordered me to bring them strawberries; if I do
		not they will kill me. Pray, good shepherds, tell me where
		to find them.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The great Setchène arose, crossed over to the month
		opposite him, and putting the wand into his hand, said:</p>

		<p>&#8220;Brother Tchervène (June), do thou take the highest
		place.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Tchervène obeyed, and as he waved his wand over the
		fire the flames leapt towards the sky. Instantly the snow
		melted, the earth was covered with verdure, trees were clothed
		with leaves, birds began to sing, and various flowers blossomed
		in the forest. It was summer. Under the bushes masses of
		star-shaped flowers changed into ripening strawberries. Before
		Marouckla had time to cross herself they covered the
		glade, making it look like a sea of blood.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Gather them quickly, Marouckla,&#8221; said Tchervène.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page22" title="22">&nbsp;</a>Joyfully she thanked the months, and having filled her
		apron ran happily home. Helen and her mother wondered
		at seeing the strawberries, which filled the house with their
		delicious fragrance.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Wherever did you find them?&#8221; asked Helen crossly.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Right up among the mountains; those from under the
		beech trees are not bad.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Helen gave a few to her mother and ate the rest herself;
		not one did she offer to her step-sister. Being tired of strawberries,
		on the third day she took a fancy for some fresh red
		apples.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Run, Marouckla,&#8221; said she, &#8220;and fetch me fresh red
		apples from the mountain.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Apples in winter, sister? why, the trees have neither
		leaves nor fruit.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Idle slut, go this minute,&#8221; said Helen; &#8220;unless you
		bring back apples we will kill you.&#8221;</p>

		<p>As before, the stepmother seized her roughly and turned
		her out of the house. The poor girl went weeping up the
		mountain, across the deep snow upon which lay no human
		footprint, and on towards the fire round which were the twelve
		months. Motionless sat they, and on the highest stone was
		the great Setchène.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Men of God, may I warm myself at your fire? The
		winter cold chills me,&#8221; said she, drawing near.</p>

		<p>The great Setchène raised his head.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Why com&#8217;st thou here? What dost thou seek?&#8221; asked he.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I am come to look for red apples,&#8221; replied Marouckla.</p>

		<p>&#8220;But this is winter, and not the season for red apples,&#8221;
		observed the great Setchène.</p>

		</div>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;I know,&#8221; answered the girl, &#8220;but my sister and stepmother
		sent me to fetch red apples from the mountain; if I
		return without them they will kill me.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Thereupon the great Setchène arose and went over to one
		of the elderly months, to whom he handed the wand, saying:</p>

		<p>&#8220;Brother Zaré (September), do thou take the highest
		place.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Zaré moved to the highest stone and waved his wand over
		the fire. There was a flare of red flames, the snow disappeared,
		but the fading leaves which trembled on the trees
		were sent by a cold north-east wind in yellow masses to the
		glade. Only a few flowers of autumn were visible, such as
		the fleabane and red gillyflower, autumn colchicums in the
		ravine, and under the beeches bracken and tufts of northern
		heather. At first Marouckla looked in vain for red apples.
		Then she espied a tree which grew at a great height, and
		from the branches of this hung the bright red fruit. Zaré
		ordered her to gather some quickly. The girl was delighted
		and shook the tree. First one apple fell, then another.</p>

		<p>&#8220;That is enough,&#8221; said Zaré, &#8220;hurry home.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Thanking the months, she returned joyfully. Helen marvelled
		and the stepmother wondered at seeing the fruit.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Where did you gather them?&#8221; asked the step-sister.</p>

		<p>&#8220;There are more on the mountain top,&#8221; answered Marouckla.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Then why did you not bring more?&#8221; said Helen angrily;
		&#8220;you must have eaten them on your way back, you wicked
		girl.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;No, dear sister, I have not even tasted them,&#8221; said
		Marouckla. &#8220;I shook the tree twice; one apple fell each
		<a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26">&nbsp;</a>time. I was not allowed to shake it again, but was told to
		return home.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;May Perum smite you with his thunderbolt,&#8221; said Helen,
		striking her.</p>

		<p>Marouckla prayed to die rather than suffer such ill-treatment.
		Weeping bitterly, she took refuge in the kitchen. Helen
		and her mother found the apples more delicious than any
		they had ever tasted, and when they had eaten both longed
		for more.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Listen, mother,&#8221; said Helen. &#8220;Give me my cloak; I will
		fetch some more apples myself, or else that good-for-nothing
		wretch will eat them all on the way. I shall be able to find
		the mountain and the tree. The shepherds may cry &#8216;Stop,&#8217;
		but I shall not leave go till I have shaken down all the
		apples.&#8221;</p>

		<p>In spite of her mother&#8217;s advice she put on her pelisse,
		covered her head with a warm hood, and took the road to
		the mountain. The mother stood and watched her till she
		was lost in the distance.</p>

		<p>Snow covered everything, not a human footprint was to
		be seen on its surface. Helen lost herself and wandered
		hither and thither. After a while she saw a light above
		her, and following in its direction reached the mountain top.
		There was the flaming fire, the twelve blocks of stone, and
		the twelve months. At first she was frightened and hesitated;
		then she came nearer and warmed her hands. She did not
		ask permission, nor did she speak one polite word.</p>

		<p>&#8220;What has brought thee here? What dost thou seek?&#8221;
		said the great Setchène severely.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I am not obliged to tell you, old greybeard; what business
		<a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27">&nbsp;</a>is it of yours?&#8221; she replied disdainfully, turning her back on
		the fire and going towards the forest.</p>

		<p>The great Setchène frowned, and waved his wand over his
		head. Instantly the sky became covered with clouds, the
		fire went down, snow fell in large flakes, an icy wind howled
		round the mountain. Amid the fury of the storm Helen
		added curses against her step-sister. The pelisse failed to
		warm her benumbed limbs. The mother kept on waiting
		for her; she looked from the window, she watched from
		the doorstep, but her daughter came not. The hours passed
		slowly, but Helen did not return.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Can it be that the apples have charmed her from her
		home?&#8221; thought the mother. Then she clad herself in hood
		and pelisse and went in search of her daughter. Snow fell
		in huge masses; it covered all things, it lay untouched by
		human footsteps. For long she wandered hither and thither;
		the icy north-east wind whistled in the mountain, but no
		voice answered her cries.</p>

		<p>Day after day Marouckla worked and prayed, and waited;
		but neither stepmother nor sister returned, they had been
		frozen to death on the mountain. The inheritance of a
		small house, a field, and a cow fell to Marouckla. In course
		of time an honest farmer came to share them with her, and
		their lives were happy and peaceful.</p>

	<p class="second_title">THE SUN; OR, THE THREE GOLDEN HAIRS
    OF THE OLD MAN VSÉVÈDE</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Can</span> this be a true story? It is said that once there was
	a king who was exceedingly fond of hunting the wild
	beasts in his forests. One day he followed a stag so far and
	so long that he lost his way. Alone and overtaken by night,
	he was glad to find himself near a small thatched cottage in
	which lived a charcoal-burner.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Will you kindly show me the way to the high-road?
	You shall be handsomely rewarded.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I would willingly,&#8221; said the charcoal-burner, &#8220;but
	God is going to send my wife a little child, and I cannot
	leave her alone. Will you pass the night under our roof?
	There is a truss of sweet hay in the loft where you may
	rest, and to-morrow morning I will be your guide.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The king accepted the invitation and went to bed in the
	loft. Shortly after a son was born to the charcoal-burner&#8217;s
	wife. But the king could not sleep. At midnight he heard
	noises in the house, and looking through a crack in the flooring
	he saw the charcoal-burner asleep, his wife almost in a faint,
	and by the side of the newly-born babe three old women
	dressed in white, each holding a lighted taper in her hand, and
	all talking together. Now these were the three Soudiché or
	Fates, you must know.</p>

	<p>The first said, &#8220;On this boy I bestow the gift of confronting
	great dangers.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The second said, &#8220;I bestow the power of happily escaping
	all these dangers, and of living to a good old age.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The third said, &#8220;I bestow upon him for wife the princess
	born at the selfsame hour as he, and daughter of the very
	king sleeping above in the loft.&#8221;</p>

	<p>At these words the lights went out and silence reigned
	around.</p>

	<p>Now the king was greatly troubled, and wondered exceedingly;
	he felt as if he had received a sword-thrust in
	the chest. He lay awake all night thinking how to prevent
	the words of the Fates from coming true.</p>

	<p>With the first glimmer of morning light the baby began
	<a class="pagenum" id="page33" title="33">&nbsp;</a>to cry. The charcoal-burner, on going over to it, found that
	his wife was dead.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Poor little orphan,&#8221; he said sadly, &#8220;what will become of
	thee without a mother&#8217;s care?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Confide this child to me,&#8221; said the king, &#8220;I will look after
	it. He shall be well provided for. You shall be given a sum
	of money large enough to keep you without having to burn
	charcoal.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The poor man gladly agreed, and the king went away
	promising to send some one for the child. The queen and
	courtiers thought it would be an agreeable surprise for the
	king to hear that a charming little princess had been born
	on the night he was away. But instead of being pleased he
	frowned, and calling one of his servants, said to him, &#8220;Go
	to the charcoal-burner&#8217;s cottage in the forest, and give the
	man this purse in exchange for a new-born infant. On
	your way back drown the child. See well that he is drowned,
	for if he should in any way escape, you yourself shall suffer
	in his place.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The servant was given the child in a basket, and on
	reaching the centre of a narrow bridge that stretched across
	a wide and deep river, he threw both basket and baby into
	the water.</p>

	<p>&#8220;A prosperous journey to you, Mr. Son-in-Law,&#8221; said the
	king, on hearing the servant&#8217;s story: for he fully believed
	the child was drowned. But it was far from being the case;
	the little one was floating happily along in its basket cradle,
	and slumbering as sweetly as if his mother had sung him
	to sleep. Now it happened that a fisherman, who was mending
	his nets before his cottage door, saw the basket floating
	<a class="pagenum" id="page34" title="34">&nbsp;</a>down the river. He jumped at once into his boat, picked
	it up, and ran to tell his wife the good news.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you have always longed for a son;
	here is a beautiful little boy the river has sent us.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The woman was delighted, and took the infant and loved
	it as her own child. They named him <em>Plavacek</em> (the floater),
	because he had come to them floating on the water.</p>

	<p>The river flowed on. Years passed away. The little
	baby grew into a handsome youth; in all the villages round
	there were none to compare with him. Now it happened
	that one summer day the king was riding unattended. And
	the heat being very great he reined in his horse before the
	fisherman&#8217;s door to ask for a drink of water. Plavacek
	brought the water. The king looked at him attentively, then
	turning to the fisherman, said, &#8220;That is a good-looking lad;
	is he your son?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;He is and he isn&#8217;t,&#8221; replied the fisherman. &#8220;I found
	him, when he was quite a tiny baby, floating down the stream
	in a basket. So we adopted him and brought him up as
	our own son.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The king turned as pale as death, for he guessed that he
	was the same child he had ordered to be drowned. Then
	recovering himself he got down from his horse and said: &#8220;I
	want a trusty messenger to take a letter to the palace, could
	you send him with it?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;With pleasure! Your majesty may be sure of its safe
	delivery.&#8221;</p>

	<div class="image">	<a class="pagenum disguise" id="page35" title="35">&nbsp;</a>
		<a href="images/illo-08.png"><img src="images/illo-08-th.png" width="314" height="476" alt="A man hands a baby to a woman." /></a>
		<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page36" title="36">&nbsp;</a>[Blank Page] -->
	</div>

	<p>Thereupon the king wrote to the queen as follows&#8212;</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8220;The man who brings you this letter is the most dangerous
		of all my enemies. Have his head cut off at once;  <!-- Original location of page 35/36 -->
		<a class="pagenum" id="page37" title="37">&nbsp;</a>no delay, no pity, he must be executed before my return.
		Such is my will and pleasure.&#8221;</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>This he carefully folded and sealed with the royal seal.</p>

	<p>Plavacek took the letter and set off immediately. But
	the forest through which he had to pass was so large, and
	the trees so thick, that he missed the path and was overtaken
	by the darkness before the journey was nearly over.
	In the midst of his trouble he met an old woman who
	said, &#8220;Where are you going, Plavacek? Where are you
	going?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am the bearer of a letter from the king to the queen,
	but have missed the path to the palace. Could you, good
	mother, put me on the right road?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Impossible to-day, my child; it is getting dark, and you
	would not have time to get there. Stay with me to-night.
	You will not be with strangers, for I am your godmother.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Plavacek agreed. Thereupon they entered a pretty little
	cottage that seemed suddenly to sink into the earth. Now
	while he slept the old woman changed his letter for another,
	which ran thus:&#8212;</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8220;Immediately upon the receipt of this letter introduce
		the bearer to the princess our daughter. I have chosen this
		young man for my son-in-law, and it is my wish they should
		be married before my return to the palace. Such is my
		pleasure.&#8221;</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>The letter was duly delivered, and when the queen had
	read it, she ordered everything to be prepared for the wedding.
	Both she and her daughter greatly enjoyed Plavacek&#8217;s
	society, and nothing disturbed the happiness of the newly
	married pair.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page38" title="38">&nbsp;</a>Within a few days the king returned, and on hearing what
	had taken place was very angry with the queen.</p>

	<p>&#8220;But you expressly bade me have the wedding before
	your return. Come, read your letter again, here it is,&#8221;
	said she.</p>

	<p>He closely examined the letter; the paper, handwriting,
	seal&#8212;all were undoubtedly his. He then called his son-in-law,
	and questioned him about his journey. Plavacek hid
	nothing: he told how he had lost his way, and how he had
	passed the night in a cottage in the forest.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What was the old woman like?&#8221; asked the king.</p>

	<p>From Plavacek&#8217;s description the king knew it was the
	very same who, twenty years before, had foretold the marriage
	of the princess with the charcoal-burner&#8217;s son. After some
	moments&#8217; thought the king said, &#8220;What is done is done.
	But you will not become my son-in-law so easily. No, i&#8217; faith!
	As a wedding present you must bring me three golden hairs
	from the head of Dède-Vsévède.&#8221;</p>

	<p>In this way he thought to get rid of his son-in-law, whose
	very presence was distasteful to him. The young fellow took
	leave of his wife and set off. &#8220;I know not which way to go,&#8221;
	said he to himself, &#8220;but my godmother the witch will surely
	help me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>But he found the way easily enough. He walked on and
	on and on for a long time over mountain, valley, and river,
	until he reached the shores of the Black Sea. There he
	found a boat and boatman.</p>

	<p>&#8220;May God bless you, old boatman,&#8221; said he.</p>

	<p>&#8220;And you, too, my young traveller. Where are you
	going?&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page39" title="39">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;To Dède-Vsévède&#8217;s castle for three of his golden
	hairs.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ah, then you are very welcome. For a long weary while
	I have been waiting for such a messenger as you. I have
	been ferrying passengers across for these twenty years, and
	not one of them has done anything to help me. If you will
	promise to ask Dède-Vsévède when I shall be released from
	my toil I will row you across.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Plavacek promised, and was rowed to the opposite bank.
	He continued his journey on foot until he came in sight of
	a large town half in ruins, near which was passing a funeral
	procession. The king of that country was following his father&#8217;s
	coffin, and with the tears running down his cheeks.</p>

	<p>&#8220;May God comfort you in your distress,&#8221; said Plavacek.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Thank you, good traveller. Where are you going?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;To the house of Dède-Vsévède in quest of three of his
	golden hairs.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;To the house of Dède-Vsévède? indeed! What a pity
	you did not come sooner, we have long been expecting such
	a messenger as you. Come and see me by and bye.&#8221;</p>

	<p>When Plavacek presented himself at court the king said
	to him:</p>

	<p>&#8220;We understand you are on your way to the house of
	Dède-Vsévède? Now we have an apple-tree here that bears
	the fruit of everlasting youth. One of these apples eaten by
	a man, even though he be dying, will cure him and make
	him young again. For the last twenty years neither fruit
	nor flower has been found on this tree. Will you ask Dède-Vsévède
	the cause of it?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That I will, with pleasure.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page40" title="40">&nbsp;</a>Then Plavacek continued his journey, and as he went
	he came to a large and beautiful city where all was sad and
	silent. Near the gate was an old man who leant on a stick
	and walked with difficulty.</p>

	<p>&#8220;May God bless you, good old man.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;And you, too, my handsome young traveller. Where
	are you going?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;To Dède-Vsévède&#8217;s palace in search of three of his
	golden hairs.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ah, you are the very messenger I have so long waited
	for. Allow me to take you to my master the king.&#8221;</p>

	<p>On their arrival at the palace, the king said, &#8220;I hear you
	are an ambassador to Dède-Vsévède. We have here a well,
	the water of which renews itself. So wonderful are its effects
	that invalids are immediately cured on drinking it, while a
	few drops sprinkled on a corpse will bring it to life again.
	For the past twenty years this well has remained dry: if
	you will ask old Dède-Vsévède how the flow of water may
	be restored I will reward you royally.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Plavacek promised to do so, and was dismissed with good
	wishes. He then travelled through deep dark forests, in
	the midst of which might be seen a large meadow; out of
	it grew lovely flowers, and in the centre stood a castle built
	of gold. It was the home of Dède-Vsévède. So brilliant
	with light was it that it seemed to be built of fire. When
	he entered there was no one there but an old woman
	spinning.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Greeting, Plavacek, I am well pleased to see you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>She was his godmother, who had given him shelter in
	her cottage when he was the bearer of the king&#8217;s letter.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page41" title="41">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Tell me what brings you here from such a distance,&#8221;
	she went on.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The king would not have me for his son-in-law, unless
	I first got him three golden hairs from the head of Dède-Vsévède.
	So he sent me here to fetch them.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The Fate laughed. &#8220;Dède-Vsévède indeed! Why, I am
	his mother, it is the shining sun himself. He is a child at
	morning time, a grown man at midday, a decrepit old man,
	looking as if he had lived a hundred years, at eventide.
	But I will see that you have the three hairs from his head;
	I am not your godmother for nothing. All the same you
	must not remain here. My son is a good lad, but when
	he comes home he is hungry, and would very probably order
	you to be roasted for his supper. Now I will turn this empty
	bucket upside down, and you shall hide underneath it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Plavacek begged the Fate to obtain from Dède-Vsévède
	the answers to the three questions he had been asked.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I will do so certainly, but you must listen to what he
	says.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Suddenly a blast of wind howled round the palace, and
	the Sun entered by a western window. He was an old man
	with golden hair.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I smell human flesh,&#8221; cried he, &#8220;I am sure of it.
	Mother, you have some one here.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Star of day,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;whom could I have here that
	you would not see sooner than I? The fact is that in your
	daily journeys the scent of human flesh is always with you,
	so when you come home at evening it clings to you still.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The old man said nothing, and sat down to supper.
	When he had finished he laid his golden head on the Fate&#8217;s
	<a class="pagenum" id="page42" title="42">&nbsp;</a>lap and went to sleep. Then she pulled out a hair and threw
	it on the ground. It fell with a metallic sound like the
	vibration of a guitar string.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What do you want, mother?&#8221; asked he.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Nothing, my son; I was sleeping, and had a strange
	dream.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What was it, mother?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I thought I was in a place where there was a well, and
	the well was fed from a spring, the water of which cured
	all diseases. Even the dying were restored to health on
	drinking that water, and the dead who were sprinkled with
	it came to life again. For the last twenty years the well
	has run dry. What must be done to restore the flow of
	water?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That is very simple. A frog has lodged itself in the
	opening of the spring, this prevents the flow of water. Kill
	the frog, and the water will return to the well.&#8221;</p>

	<p>He slept again, and the old woman pulled out another
	golden hair, and threw it on the ground.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Mother, what do you want?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Nothing, my son, nothing; I was dreaming. In my
	dream I saw a large town, the name of which I have forgotten.
	And there grew an apple-tree the fruit of which
	had the power to make the old young again. A single apple
	eaten by an old man would restore to him the vigour and
	freshness of youth. For twenty years this tree has not borne
	fruit. What can be done to make it fruitful?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;The means are not difficult. A snake hidden among
	the roots destroys the sap. Kill the snake, transplant the
	tree, and the fruit will grow as before.&#8221;</p>

	</div>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page45" title="45">&nbsp;</a>He again fell asleep, and the old woman pulled out another
	golden hair.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now look here, mother, why will you not let me sleep?&#8221;
	said the old man, really vexed; and he would have got up.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Lie down, my darling son, do not disturb yourself. I
	am sorry I awoke you, but I have had a very strange dream.
	It seemed that I saw a boatman on the shores of the Black
	Sea, and he complained that he had been toiling at the ferry
	for twenty years without any one having come to take his
	place. For how much longer must this poor old man continue
	to row?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;He is a silly fellow. He has but to place his oars in
	the hands of the first comer and jump ashore. Whoever
	receives the oars will replace him as ferryman. But leave me
	in peace now, mother, and do not wake me again. I have
	to rise very early, and must first dry the eyes of a princess.
	The poor thing spends all night weeping for her husband who
	has been sent by the king to get three of my golden hairs.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Next morning the wind whistled round Dède-Vsévède&#8217;s
	palace, and instead of an old man, a beautiful child with
	golden hair awoke on the old woman&#8217;s lap. It was the
	glorious sun. He bade her good-bye, and flew out of the
	eastern window. The old woman turned up the bucket and
	said to Plavacek, &#8220;Look, here are the three golden hairs.
	You now know the answers to your questions. May God
	direct you and send you a prosperous journey. You will
	not see me again, for you will have no further need of me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>He thanked her gratefully and left her. On arriving at
	the town with the dried-up well, he was questioned by the
	king as to what news he had brought.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page46" title="46">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Have the well carefully cleaned out,&#8221; said he, &#8220;kill the
	frog that obstructs the spring, and the wonderful water will
	flow again.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The king did as he was advised, and rejoiced to see the
	water return. He gave Plavacek twelve swan-white horses,
	and as much gold and silver as they could carry.</p>

	<p>On reaching the second town and being asked by the
	king what news he had brought, he replied, &#8220;Excellent; one
	could not wish for better. Dig up your apple-tree, kill the
	snake that lies among the roots, transplant the tree, and it
	will produce apples like those of former times.&#8221;</p>

	<p>And all turned out as he had said, for no sooner was the
	tree replanted than it was covered with blossoms that gave
	it the appearance of a sea of roses. The delighted king
	gave him twelve raven-black horses, laden with as much wealth
	as they could carry. He then journeyed to the shores of
	the Black Sea. There the boatman questioned him as to
	what news he had brought respecting his release. Plavacek
	first crossed with his twenty-four horses to the opposite bank,
	and then replied that the boatman might gain his freedom
	by placing the oars in the hands of the first traveller who
	wished to be ferried over.</p>

	<p>Plavacek&#8217;s royal father-in-law could not believe his eyes
	when he saw Dède-Vsévède&#8217;s three golden hairs. As for
	the princess, his young wife, she wept tears, but of joy, not
	sadness, to see her dear one again, and she said to him,
	&#8220;How did you get such splendid horses and so much wealth,
	dear husband?&#8221;</p>

	<p>And he answered her, &#8220;All this represents the price paid
	for the weariness of spirit I have felt; it is the ready money
	<a class="pagenum" id="page47" title="47">&nbsp;</a>for hardships endured and services given. Thus, I showed
	one king how to regain possession of the Apples of Youth:
	to another I told the secret of reopening the spring of water
	that gives health and life.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Apples of Youth! Water of Life!&#8221; interrupted the king.
	&#8220;I will certainly go and find these treasures for myself. Ah,
	what joy! having eaten of these apples I shall become young
	again; having drunk of the Water of Immortality, I shall live
	for ever.&#8221;</p>

	<p>And he started off in search of these treasures. But he
	has not yet returned from his search.</p>

			THE SOVEREIGN OF THE MINERAL KINGDOM</h3>

		<p class="return_toc"><a href="#contents" title="Return to Contents">ToC</a></p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Once</span> upon a time, and a long long time ago it was,
		there lived a widow who had a very pretty daughter.
		The mother, good honest woman, was quite content with her
		station in life. But with the daughter it was otherwise; she,
		like a spoilt beauty, looked contemptuously upon her many
		admirers, her mind was full of proud and ambitious thoughts,
		and the more lovers she had, the prouder she became.</p>

		<p>One beautiful moonlight night the mother awoke, and
		being unable to sleep, began to pray God for the happiness
		of her only child, though she often made her mother&#8217;s life
		miserable. The fond woman looked lovingly at the beautiful
		daughter sleeping by her side, and she wondered, as she
		saw her smile, what happy dream had visited her. Then
		<a class="pagenum" id="page52" title="52">&nbsp;</a>she finished her prayer, and laying her head on the girl&#8217;s
		pillow, fell asleep. Next day she said, &#8220;Come, darling child,
		tell me what you were dreaming about last night, you looked
		so happy smiling in your sleep.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Oh yes, mother, I remember. I had a very beautiful
		dream. I thought a rich nobleman came to our house, in
		a splendid carriage of brass, and gave me a ring set with
		stones, that sparkled like the stars of heaven. When I entered
		the church with him, it was full of people, and they all
		thought me divine and adorable, like the Blessed Virgin.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Ah! my child, what sin! May God keep you from
		such dreams.&#8221;</p>

		<p>But the daughter ran away singing, and busied herself
		about the house. The same day a handsome young farmer
		drove into the village in his cart and begged them to come
		and share his country bread. He was a kind fellow, and
		the mother liked him much. But the daughter refused his
		invitation, and insulted him into the bargain.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Even if you had driven in a carriage of brass,&#8221; she said,
		&#8220;and had offered me a ring set with stones shining as the
		stars in heaven, I would never have married you&#8212;you, a
		mere peasant!&#8221;</p>

		<p>The young farmer was terribly upset at her words, and
		with a prayer for her soul, returned home a saddened man.
		But her mother scolded and reproached her.</p>

		<p>The next night the woman again awoke, and taking her
		rosary prayed with still greater fervour, that God would bless
		her child. This time the girl laughed as she slept.</p>

		<p>&#8220;What can the poor child be dreaming about?&#8221; she
		said to herself: and sighing she prayed for her again. Then
		<a class="pagenum" id="page53" title="53">&nbsp;</a>she laid her head upon her pillow and tried in vain to sleep.
		In the morning, when her daughter was dressing, she said:
		&#8220;Well, my dear, you were dreaming again last night, and
		laughing like a maniac.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Was I? Listen, I dreamt a nobleman came for me
		in a silver carriage, and gave me a golden diadem. When
		I entered the church with him, the people admired and
		worshipped me more than the Blessed Virgin.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Ay me, what a terrible dream! what a wicked dream!
		Pray God not to lead you into temptation.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Then she scolded her daughter severely and went out,
		slamming the door after her. That same day a carriage drove
		into the village, and some gentlemen invited mother and
		daughter to share the bread of the lord of the manor. The
		mother considered such an offer a great honour, but the
		daughter refused it and replied to the gentlemen scornfully:
		&#8220;Even if you had come to fetch me in a carriage of solid
		silver and had presented me with a golden diadem, I would
		never have consented to be the wife of your lord.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The gentlemen turned away in disgust and returned home;
		the mother rebuked her severely for so much pride.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Miserable, foolish girl!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;pride is a breath
		from hell. It is your duty to be humble, honest, and sweet-tempered.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The daughter replied by a laugh.</p>

		<p>The third night she slept soundly, but the poor woman at
		her side could not close her eyes. Tormented with dark forebodings,
		she feared some misfortune was about to happen,
		and counted her beads, praying fervently. All at once the
		young sleeper began to sneer and laugh.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page54" title="54">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Merciful God! ah me!&#8221; cried the poor woman, &#8220;what
		are these dreams that worry her poor brain!&#8221;</p>

		<p>In the morning she said, &#8220;What made you sneer so frightfully
		last night? You must have had bad dreams again,
		my poor child.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Now, mother, you look as if you were going to preach
		again.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;No, no; but I want to know what you were dreaming
		about.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Well, I dreamt some one drove up in a golden carriage
		and asked me to marry him, and he brought me a mantle
		of cloth of pure gold. When we came into church, the crowd
		pressed forward to kneel before me.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The mother wrung her hands piteously, and the girl left
		the room to avoid hearing her lamentations. That same
		day three carriages entered the yard, one of brass, one of
		silver, and one of gold. The first was drawn by two, the
		second by three, the third by four magnificent horses. Gentlemen
		wearing scarlet gloves and green mantles got out of
		the brass and silver carriages, while from the golden carriage
		alighted a prince who, as the sun shone on him, looked as
		if he were dressed in gold. They all made their way to the
		widow and asked for her daughter&#8217;s hand.</p>

		<div class="image"><a class="pagenum disguise" id="page55" title="55">&nbsp;</a>
			<a href="images/illo-11.png"><img src="images/illo-11-th.png" width="314" height="493" alt="A woman stands on a doorstep; another woman stands behind her." /></a>
			<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page56" title="56">&nbsp;</a>[Blank Page] -->
		</div>

		<p>&#8220;I fear we are not worthy of so much honour,&#8221; replied
		the widow meekly, but when the daughter&#8217;s eyes fell upon
		her suitor she recognised in him the lover of her dreams, and
		withdrew to weave an aigrette of many-coloured feathers.
		In exchange for this aigrette which she offered her bridegroom,
		he placed upon her finger a ring set with stones that shone
		like the stars in heaven, and over her shoulders a mantle  <!-- Original position of pages 55 & 56 -->
		<a class="pagenum" id="page57" title="57">&nbsp;</a>of cloth of gold. The young bride, beside herself with joy,
		retired to complete her toilette. Meanwhile the anxious
		mother, a prey to the blackest forebodings, said to her son-in-law,
		&#8220;My daughter has consented to share your bread, tell
		me of what sort of flour it is made?&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;In our house we have bread of brass, of silver, and of
		gold; my wife will be free to choose.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Such a reply astonished her more than ever, and made
		her still more unhappy. The daughter asked no questions,
		was in fact content to know nothing, not even what her
		mother suffered. She looked magnificent in her bridal
		attire and golden mantle, but she left her home with the
		prince without saying good-bye either to her mother or to
		her youthful companions. Neither did she ask her mother&#8217;s
		blessing, though the latter wept and prayed for her safety.</p>

		<p>After the marriage ceremony they mounted the golden
		carriage and set off, followed by the attendants of silver and
		brass. The procession moved slowly along the road without
		stopping until it reached the foot of a high rock. Here,
		instead of a carriage entrance, was a large cavern which led
		out into a steep slope down which the horses went lower and
		lower. The giant <em>Zémo-tras</em> (he who makes the earthquakes)
		closed the opening with a huge stone. They made their
		way in darkness for some time, the terrified bride being
		reassured by her husband.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Fear nothing,&#8221; said he, &#8220;in a little while it will be
		clear and beautiful.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Grotesque dwarfs, carrying lighted torches, appeared on
		all sides, saluted and welcomed their King Kovlad as they
		illumined the road for him and his attendants. Then for
		<a class="pagenum" id="page58" title="58">&nbsp;</a>the first time the girl knew she had married Kovlad, but this
		mattered little to her. On coming out from these gloomy
		passages into the open they found themselves surrounded
		by large forests and mountains, mountains that seemed to
		touch the sky. And, strange to relate, all the trees of whatsoever
		kind, and even the mountains that seemed to touch
		the sky, were of solid lead. When they had crossed these
		marvellous mountains the giant Zémo-tras closed all the
		openings in the road they had passed. They then drove
		out upon vast and beautiful plains, in the centre of which
		was a golden palace covered with precious stones. The
		bride was weary with looking at so many wonders, and
		gladly sat down to the feast prepared by the dwarfs. Meats
		of many kinds were served, roast and boiled, but lo! they
		were of metal&#8212;brass, silver, and gold. Every one ate heartily
		and enjoyed the food, but the young wife, with tears in her
		eyes, begged for a piece of bread.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Certainly, madam, with pleasure,&#8221; answered Kovlad.
		But she could not eat the bread which was brought, for it was
		of brass. Then the king sent for a piece of silver bread, still
		she could not eat it; and again for a slice of golden bread,
		that too she was unable to bite. The servants did all they
		could to get something to their mistress&#8217;s taste, but she found
		it impossible to eat anything.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I should be most happy to gratify you,&#8221; said Kovlad
		&#8220;but we have no other kind of food.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Then she realised for the first time in whose power she
		had placed herself, and she began to weep bitterly and wish
		she had taken her mother&#8217;s advice.</p>

		<p>&#8220;It is of no use to weep and regret,&#8221; said Kovlad,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page59" title="59">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;you must have known the kind of bread you would have
		to break here; your wish has been fulfilled.&#8221;</p>

		<p>And so it was, for nothing can recall the past. The
		wretched girl was obliged henceforth to live underground
		with her husband Kovlad, the God of Metals, in his golden
		palace. And this because she had set her heart upon nothing
		but the possession of gold, and had never wished for anything
		better.</p>

			children to whom he could leave his wealth. He was, besides,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page61" title="61">&nbsp;</a>no longer young. Every day he and his wife went to church
			to pray for a son. At last, after long waiting, God sent them
			what they desired. Now the evening before its arrival the
			father dreamed that its chance of living would depend upon
			one condition, namely, that its feet never touched the earth
			until it was twelve years old. Great care was taken that this
			should be avoided, and when the little stranger came, only
			trustworthy nurses were employed to look after him. As
			the years passed on the child was diligently guarded, sometimes
			he was carried in his nurses&#8217; arms, sometimes rocked
			in his golden cradle, but his feet never touched the ground.</p>

			<p>Now when the end of the time drew near the father began
			preparations for a magnificent feast which should be given
			to celebrate his son&#8217;s release. One day while these were in
			progress a frightful noise, followed by most unearthly yells,
			shook the castle. The nurse dropped the child in her terror
			and ran to the window: that instant the noises ceased. On
			turning to take up the boy, imagine her dismay when she
			found him no longer there, and remembered that she had
			disobeyed her master&#8217;s orders.</p>

			<p>Hearing her screams and lamentations, all the servants
			of the castle ran to her. The father soon followed, asking,
			&#8220;What is the matter? What has happened? Where is my
			child?&#8221; The nurse, trembling and weeping, told of the disappearance
			of his son, his only child. No words can tell
			the anguish of the father&#8217;s heart. He sent servants in every
			direction to hunt for his boy, he gave orders, he begged and
			prayed, he threw away money right and left, he promised
			everything if only his son might be restored to him. Search
			was made without loss of time, but no trace of him could be
			<a class="pagenum" id="page62" title="62">&nbsp;</a>discovered; he had vanished as completely as if he had never
			existed.</p>

			<p>Many years later the unhappy nobleman learnt that in one
			of the most beautiful rooms of the castle, footsteps, as of
			some one walking up and down, and dismal groans, were
			heard every midnight. Anxious to follow the matter up,
			for he thought it might in some way concern his lost son, he
			made known that a reward of three hundred gold pieces would
			be given to any one who would watch for one whole night
			in the haunted room. Many were willing, but had not the
			courage to stay till the end; for at midnight, when the dismal
			groans were heard, they would run away rather than risk their
			lives for three hundred gold pieces. The poor father was
			in despair, and knew not how to discover the truth of this
			dark mystery.</p>

			<p>Now close to the castle dwelt a widow, a miller by trade,
			who had three daughters. They were very poor, and hardly
			earned enough for their daily needs. When they heard of
			the midnight noises in the castle and the promised reward,
			the eldest daughter said, &#8220;As we are so very poor we have
			nothing to lose; surely we might try to earn these three hundred
			gold pieces by remaining in the room one night. I
			should like to try, mother, if you will let me.&#8221;</p>

			<p>The mother shrugged her shoulders, she hardly knew
			what to say; but when she thought of their poverty and
			the difficulty they had to earn a living she gave permission
			for her eldest daughter to remain one night in the
			haunted room. Then the daughter went to ask the nobleman&#8217;s
			consent.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Have you really the courage to watch for a whole night
			<a class="pagenum" id="page63" title="63">&nbsp;</a>in a room haunted by ghosts? Are you sure you are not
			afraid, my good girl?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;I am willing to try this very night,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I
			would only ask you to give me some food to cook for my
			supper, for I am very hungry.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Orders were given that she should be supplied with everything
			she wanted, and indeed enough food was given her, not
			for one supper only, but for three. With the food, some dry
			firewood and a candle, she entered the room. Like a good
			housewife, she first lit the fire and put on her saucepans, then
			she laid the table and made the bed. This filled up the early
			part of the evening. The time passed so quickly that she was
			surprised to hear the clock strike twelve, while at the last
			stroke, footsteps, as of some one walking, shook the room,
			and dismal groans filled the air. The frightened girl ran from
			one corner to the other, but could not see any one. But the
			footsteps and the groans did not cease. Suddenly a young
			man approached her and asked, &#8220;For whom is this food
			cooked?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;For myself,&#8221; she said.</p>

			<p>The gentle face of the stranger saddened, and after a short
			silence he asked again, &#8220;And this table, for whom is it laid?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;For myself,&#8221; she replied.</p>

			<p>The brow of the young man clouded over, and the beautiful
			blue eyes filled with tears as he asked once more, &#8220;And
			this bed, for whom have you made it?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;For myself,&#8221; replied she in the same selfish and indifferent
			tone.</p>

			<p>Tears fell from his eyes as he waved his arms and
			vanished.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page64" title="64">&nbsp;</a>Next morning she told the nobleman all that had
			happened, but without mentioning the painful impression her
			answers had made upon the stranger. The three hundred
			golden crowns were paid, and the father was thankful to have
			at last heard something that might possibly lead to the discovery
			of his son.</p>

			<p>On the following day the second daughter, having been
			told by her sister what to do and how to answer the stranger,
			went to the castle to offer her services. The nobleman willingly
			agreed, and orders were given that she should be
			provided with everything she might want. Without loss of
			time she entered the room, lit the fire, put on the saucepans,
			spread a white cloth upon the table, made the bed, and
			awaited the hour of midnight. When the young stranger
			appeared and asked, &#8220;For whom is this food prepared?
			for whom is the table laid? for whom is the bed made?&#8221;
			she answered as her sister had bidden her, &#8220;For me, for
			myself only.&#8221;</p>

			<p>As on the night before, he burst into tears, waved his
			arms, and suddenly disappeared.</p>

			<p>Next morning she told the nobleman all that had happened
			except the sad impression her answers had made upon the
			stranger. The three hundred gold pieces were given her, and
			she went home.</p>

			<p>On the third day the youngest daughter wanted to try her
			fortune.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Sisters,&#8221; said she, &#8220;as you have succeeded in earning
			three hundred gold crowns each, and so helping our dear
			mother, I too should like to do my part and remain a night
			in the haunted room.&#8221;</p>

			</div>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page67" title="67">&nbsp;</a>Now the widow loved her youngest daughter more dearly
			than the others, and dreaded to expose her to any danger;
			but as the elder ones had been successful, she allowed her
			to take her chance. So with the instructions from her sisters
			as to what she should do and say, and with the nobleman&#8217;s
			consent and abundant provisions, she entered the haunted
			room. Having lit the fire, put on the saucepans, laid the
			table and made the bed, she awaited with hope and fear the
			hour of midnight.</p>

			<p>As twelve o&#8217;clock struck, the room was shaken by the
			footsteps of some one who walked up and down, and the air
			was filled with cries and groans. The girl looked everywhere,
			but no living being could she see. Suddenly there stood
			before her a young man who asked in a sweet voice, &#8220;For
			whom have you prepared this food?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Now her sisters had told her how to answer and how to
			act, but when she looked into the sad eyes of the stranger
			she resolved to treat him more kindly.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Well, you do not answer me; for whom is the food
			prepared?&#8221; he asked again impatiently, as she made no
			reply. Somewhat confused, she said, &#8220;I prepared it for
			myself, but you too are welcome to it.&#8221;</p>

			<p>At these words his brow grew more serene.</p>

			<p>&#8220;And this table, for whom is it spread?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;For myself, unless you will honour me by being my
			guest.&#8221;</p>

			<p>A bright smile illumined his face.</p>

			<p>&#8220;And this bed, for whom have you made it?&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;For myself, but if you have need of rest it is for you.&#8221;</p>

			<p>He clapped his hands for joy and replied, &#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s
			<a class="pagenum" id="page68" title="68">&nbsp;</a>right; I accept the invitation with pleasure, and all that you
			have been so kind as to offer me. But wait, I pray you
			wait for me; I must first thank my kind friends for the care
			they have taken of me.&#8221;</p>

			<p>A fresh warm breath of spring filled the air, while at the
			same moment a deep precipice opened in the middle of
			the floor. He descended lightly, and she, anxious to see
			what would happen, followed him, holding on to his mantle.
			Thus they both reached the bottom of the precipice. Down
			there a new world opened itself before her eyes. To the
			right flowed a river of liquid gold, to the left rose high
			mountains of solid gold, in the centre lay a large meadow
			covered with millions of flowers. The stranger went on,
			the girl followed unnoticed. And as he went he saluted
			the field flowers as old friends, caressing them and leaving
			them with regret. Then they came to a forest where the
			trees were of gold. Many birds of different kinds began to
			sing, and flying round the young stranger perched familiarly
			on his head and shoulders. He spoke to and petted each one.
			While thus engaged, the girl broke off a branch from one of the
			golden trees and hid it in remembrance of this strange land.</p>

			<p>Leaving the forest of gold, they reached a wood where all
			the trees were of silver. Their arrival was greeted by an
			immense number of animals of various kinds. These crowded
			together and pushed one against another to get close to their
			friend. He spoke to each one and stroked and petted them.
			Meanwhile the girl broke off a branch of silver from one of the
			trees, saying to herself, &#8220;These will serve me as tokens of this
			wonderful land, for my sisters would not believe me if I only
			told them of it.&#8221;</p>

			<div class="image"><a class="pagenum disguise" id="page69" title="69">&nbsp;</a>

				<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page70" title="70">&nbsp;</a>[Blank Page] -->
			</div>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page71" title="71">&nbsp;</a>When the young stranger had taken leave of all his friends
			he returned by the paths he had come, and the girl followed
			without being seen. Arrived at the foot of the precipice, he
			began to ascend, she coming silently after, holding on to his
			mantle. Up they went higher and higher, until they reached
			the room in the castle. The floor closed up without trace of
			the opening. The girl returned to her place by the fire, where
			she was standing when the young man approached.</p>

			<p>&#8220;All my farewells have been spoken,&#8221; said he, &#8220;now we
			can have supper.&#8221;</p>

			<p>She hastened to place upon the table the food so hurriedly
			prepared, and sitting side by side they supped together. When
			they had made a good meal he said, &#8220;Now it is time to rest.&#8221;</p>

			<p>He lay down on the carefully-made bed, and the girl
			placed by his side the gold and silver branches she had
			picked in the Mineral Land. In a few moments he was
			sleeping peacefully.</p>

			<p>Next day the sun was already high in the sky, and yet the
			girl had not come to give an account of herself. The nobleman
			became impatient; he waited and waited, becoming more
			and more uneasy. At last he determined to go and see for
			himself what had happened. Picture to yourself his surprise
			and joy, when on entering the haunted chamber he saw his
			long-lost son sleeping on the bed, while beside him sat the
			widow&#8217;s beautiful daughter. At that moment the son awoke.
			The father, overwhelmed with joy, summoned the attendants
			of the castle to rejoice with him in his new-found happiness.</p>

			<p>Then the young man saw the two branches of metal, and
			said with astonishment, &#8220;What do I see? Did you then follow
			me down there? Know that by this act you have broken
			<a class="pagenum" id="page72" title="72">&nbsp;</a>the spell and released me from the enchantment. These two
			branches will make two palaces for our future dwelling.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Thereupon he took the branches and threw them out of
			the window. Immediately there were seen two magnificent
			palaces, one of gold, the other of silver. And there they lived
			happily as man and wife, the nobleman&#8217;s son and the miller&#8217;s
			daughter. And if not dead they live there still.</p>

	</div>

	<p class="second_title">THE MAID WITH HAIR OF GOLD</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">There</span> was once a king so wise and clever that he
	understood the language of all animals. You shall hear
	how he gained this power.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page76" title="76">&nbsp;</a>One day an old woman came to the palace and said, &#8220;I
	wish to speak to his majesty, for I have something of great
	importance to tell him.&#8221; When admitted to his presence she
	presented him with a curious fish, saying, &#8220;Have it cooked for
	yourself, and when you have eaten it you will understand all
	that is said by the birds of the air, the animals that walk the
	earth, and the fishes that live under the waters.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The king was delighted to know that which every one else
	was ignorant of, so he rewarded the old woman generously, and
	told a servant to cook the fish very carefully.</p>

	<p>&#8220;But take care,&#8221; said the monarch, &#8220;that you do not
	taste it yourself, for if you do you will be killed.&#8221;</p>

	<p>George, the servant, was astonished at such a threat, and
	wondered why his master was so anxious that no one else
	should eat any of the fish. Then examining it curiously he
	said, &#8220;Never in all my life have I seen such an odd-looking
	fish; it seems more like a reptile. Now where would be the
	harm if I did take some? Every cook tastes of the dishes he
	prepares.&#8221;</p>

	<p>When it was fried he tasted a small piece, and while taking
	some of the sauce heard a buzzing in the air and a voice
	speaking in his ear.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Let us taste a crumb: let us taste a little,&#8221; it said.</p>

	<p>He looked round to see where the words came from,
	but there were only a few flies buzzing about in the
	kitchen. At the same moment some one out in the yard
	said in a harsh jerky voice, &#8220;Where are we going to settle?
	Where?&#8221;</p>

	<p>And another answered, &#8220;In the miller&#8217;s barley-field; ho!
	for the miller&#8217;s field of barley.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page77" title="77">&nbsp;</a>When George looked towards where this strange talk came
	he saw a gander flying at the head of a flock of geese.</p>

	<p>&#8220;How lucky,&#8221; thought he; &#8220;now I know why my master
	set so much value on this fish and wished to eat it all
	himself.&#8221;</p>

	<p>George had now no doubt that by tasting the fish he had
	learnt the language of animals, so after having taken a little
	more he served the king with the remainder as if nothing had
	happened.</p>

	<p>When his majesty had dined he ordered George to saddle
	two horses and accompany him for a ride. They were soon
	off, the master in front, the servant behind.</p>

	<p>While crossing a meadow George&#8217;s horse began to prance
	and caper, neighing out these words, &#8220;I say, brother, I feel so
	light and in such good spirits to-day that in one single bound
	I could leap over those mountains yonder.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I could do the same,&#8221; answered the king&#8217;s horse, &#8220;but
	I carry a feeble old man on my back; he would fall like a log
	and break his skull.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What does that matter to you? So much the better if
	he should break his head, for then, instead of being ridden by
	an old man you would probably be mounted by a young one.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The servant laughed a good deal upon hearing this conversation
	between the horses, but he took care to do so on the
	quiet, lest the king should hear him. At that moment his
	majesty turned round, and, seeing a smile on the man&#8217;s face,
	asked the cause of it.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh nothing, your majesty, only some nonsense that
	came into my head.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The king said nothing, and asked no more questions, but
	<a class="pagenum" id="page78" title="78">&nbsp;</a>he was suspicious, and distrusted both servant and horses; so
	he hastened back to the palace.</p>

	<p>When there he said to George, &#8220;Give me some wine, but
	mind you only pour out enough to fill the glass, for if you put
	in one drop too much, so that it overflows, I shall certainly
	order my executioner to cut off your head.&#8221;</p>

	<p>While he was speaking two birds flew near the window, one
	chasing the other, who carried three golden hairs in his beak.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Give them me,&#8221; said one, &#8220;you know they are mine.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Not at all, I picked them up myself.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No matter, I saw them fall while the Maid with Locks of
	Gold was combing out her hair. At least, give me two, then
	you can keep the third for yourself.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, not a single one.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Thereupon one of the birds succeeded in seizing the hairs
	from the other bird&#8217;s beak, but in the struggle he let one fall,
	and it made a sound as if a piece of metal had struck the
	ground. As for George, he was completely taken off his guard,
	and the wine overflowed the glass.</p>

	<p>The king was furious, and feeling convinced that his
	servant had disobeyed him and had learnt the language of
	animals, he said, &#8220;You scoundrel, you deserve death for
	having failed to do my bidding, nevertheless, I will show
	you mercy upon one condition, that you bring me the Maid
	with the Golden Locks, for I intend to marry her.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Alas, what was to be done? Poor fellow, he was willing
	to do anything to save his life, even run the risk of losing it
	on a long journey. He therefore promised to search for
	the Maid with the Golden Locks: but he knew not where or
	how to find her.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page79" title="79">&nbsp;</a>When he had saddled and mounted his horse he allowed
	it to go its own way, and it carried him to the outskirts of a
	dark forest, where some shepherds had left a bush burning.
	The sparks of fire from the bush endangered the lives of a
	large number of ants which had built their nest close by, and
	the poor little things were hurrying away in all directions,
	carrying their small white eggs with them.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Help us in our distress, good George,&#8221; they cried in a
	plaintive voice; &#8220;do not leave us to perish, together with our
	children whom we carry in these eggs.&#8221;</p>

	<p>George immediately dismounted, cut down the bush, and
	put out the fire.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Thank you, brave man: and remember, when you are
	in trouble you have only to call upon us, and we will help you
	in our turn.&#8221; The young fellow went on his way far into
	the forest until he came to a very tall fir tree. At the top of
	the tree was a raven&#8217;s nest, while at the foot, on the ground,
	lay two young ones who were calling out to their parents and
	saying, &#8220;Alas, father and mother, where have you gone?
	You have flown away, and we have to seek our food, weak
	and helpless as we are. Our wings are as yet without feathers,
	how then shall we be able to get anything to eat? Good
	George,&#8221; said they, turning to the young man, &#8220;do not leave
	us to starve.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Without stopping to think, the young man dismounted,
	and with his sword slew his horse to provide food for the
	young birds. They thanked him heartily, and said, &#8220;If ever
	you should be in distress, call to us and we will help you at
	once.&#8221;</p>

	<p>After this George was obliged to travel on foot, and he
	<a class="pagenum" id="page80" title="80">&nbsp;</a>walked on for a long time, ever getting further and further
	into the forest. On reaching the end of it, he saw stretching
	before him an immense sea that seemed to mingle with
	the horizon. Close by stood two men disputing the possession
	of a large fish with golden scales that had fallen into
	their net.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The net belongs to me,&#8221; said one, &#8220;therefore the fish
	must be mine.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Your net would not have been of the slightest use, for
	it would have been lost in the sea, had I not come with my
	boat just in the nick of time.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, you shall have the next haul I make.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;And suppose you should catch nothing? No; give me
	this one and keep the next haul for yourself.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am going to put an end to your quarrel,&#8221; said George,
	addressing them. &#8220;Sell me the fish: I will pay you well, and
	you can divide the money between you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Thereupon he put into their hands all the money the king
	had given him for the journey, without keeping a single coin
	for himself. The fishermen rejoiced at the good fortune which
	had befallen them, but George put the fish back into the water.
	The fish, thankful for this unexpected freedom, dived and disappeared,
	but returning to the surface, said, &#8220;Whenever you
	may need my help you have but to call me, I shall not fail to
	show my gratitude.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; asked the fisherman.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am in search of a wife for my old master; she is known
	as the Maid with the Golden Locks: but I am at a loss where
	to find her.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;If that be all, we can easily give you information,&#8221;  <!-- Original location of pages 81 & 82 -->
	<a class="pagenum" id="page83" title="83">&nbsp;</a>answered they. &#8220;She is Princess Zlato Vlaska, and daughter
	of the king whose crystal palace is built on that island
	yonder. The golden light from the princess&#8217;s hair is reflected
	on sea and sky every morning when she combs it. If you
	would like to go to the island we will take you there for
	nothing, in return for the clever and generous way by which
	you made us stop quarrelling. But beware of one thing:
	when in the palace do not make a mistake as to which is the
	princess, for there are twelve of them, but only Zlato Vlaska
	has hair of gold.&#8221;</p>

	<p>When George reached the island he lost no time in making
	his way to the palace, and demanded from the king the hand
	of his daughter, Princess Zlato Vlaska, in marriage to the
	king his master.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I will grant the request with pleasure,&#8221; said his majesty,
	&#8220;but only on one condition, namely, that you perform certain
	tasks which I will set you. These will be three in number,
	and must be done in three days, just as I order you. For
	the present you had better rest and refresh yourself after your
	journey.&#8221;</p>

	<p>On the next day the king said, &#8220;My daughter, the Maid
	with the Golden Hair, had a string of fine pearls, and the
	thread having broken, the pearls were scattered far and wide
	among the long grass of this field. Go and pick up every one
	of the pearls, for they must all be found.&#8221;</p>

	<p>George went into the meadow, which was of great length
	and stretched away far out of sight. He went down on his
	knees and hunted between the tufts of grass and bramble
	from morning until noon, but not a single pearl could he
	find.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page84" title="84">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Ah, if I only had my good little ants here,&#8221; he cried,
	&#8220;they would be able to help me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Here we are, young man, at your service,&#8221; answered the
	ants, suddenly appearing. Then they all ran round him,
	crying out, &#8220;What is the matter? What do you want?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I have to find all the pearls lost in this field, and cannot
	see a single one: can you help me?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Wait a little, we will soon get them for you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>He had not to wait very long, for they brought him a
	heap of pearls, and all he had to do was to thread them
	on the string. Just as he was about to make a knot he
	saw a lame ant coming slowly towards him, for one of her
	feet had been burned in the bush fire.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Wait a moment, George,&#8221; she called out; &#8220;do not tie
	the knot before threading this last pearl I am bringing
	you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>When George took his pearls to the king, his majesty
	first counted them to make sure they were all there, and
	then said, &#8220;You have done very well in this test, to-morrow
	I will give you another.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Early next morning the king summoned George to him
	and said, &#8220;My daughter, the Princess with the Golden Hair,
	dropped her gold ring into the sea while bathing. You must
	find the jewel and bring it me to-day.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The young fellow walked thoughtfully up and down the
	beach. The water was pure and transparent, but he could
	not see beyond a certain distance into its depths, and therefore
	could not tell where the ring was lying beneath the
	water.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ah, my golden fishling, why are you not here now?
	<a class="pagenum" id="page85" title="85">&nbsp;</a>You would surely be able to help me,&#8221; he said to himself,
	speaking aloud.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Here I am,&#8221; answered the fish&#8217;s voice from the sea,
	&#8220;what can I do for you?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I have to find a gold ring which has been dropped in
	the sea, but as I cannot see to the bottom there is no use
	looking.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The fish said, &#8220;Fortunately I have just met a pike, wearing
	a gold ring on his fin. Just wait a moment, will you?&#8221;</p>

	<p>In a very short time he reappeared with the pike and
	the ring. The pike willingly gave up the jewel.</p>

	<p>The king thanked George for his cleverness, and then
	told him the third task. &#8220;If you really wish me to give
	the hand of my daughter with the golden hair to the
	monarch who has sent you here, you must bring me two
	things that I want above everything: the Water of Death
	and the Water of Life.&#8221;</p>

	<p>George had not the least idea where to find these
	waters, so he determined to trust to chance and &#8220;follow his
	nose,&#8221; as the saying is. He went first in one direction and
	then in another, until he reached a dark forest.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ah, if my little ravens were but here, perhaps they
	would help me,&#8221; he said aloud.</p>

	<p>Suddenly there was heard a rushing noise, as of wings
	overhead, and then down came the ravens calling &#8220;Krâk,
	krâk, here we are, ready and willing to help you. What are
	you looking for?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I want some of the Water of Death and the Water of
	Life: it is impossible for me to find them, for I don&#8217;t know
	where to look.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page86" title="86">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Krâk, krâk, we know very well where to find some.
	Wait a moment.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Off they went immediately, but soon returned, each with
	a small gourd in his beak. One gourd contained the Water
	of Life, the other the Water of Death.</p>

	<p>George was delighted with his success, and went back on
	his way to the palace. When nearly out of the forest, he saw
	a spider&#8217;s web hanging between two fir trees, while in the
	centre was a large spider devouring a fly he had just killed.
	George sprinkled a few drops of the Water of Death on the
	spider; it immediately left the fly, which rolled to the ground
	like a ripe cherry, but on being touched with the Water of
	Life she began to move, and stretching out first one limb and
	then another, gradually freed herself from the spider&#8217;s web.
	Then she spread her wings and took flight, having first buzzed
	these words in the ears of her deliverer: &#8220;George, you have
	assured your own happiness by restoring mine, for without
	my help you would never have succeeded in recognising the
	Princess with the Golden Hair when you choose her to-morrow
	from among her twelve sisters.&#8221;</p>

	<p>And the fly was right, for though the king, on finding that
	George had accomplished the third task, agreed to give him
	his daughter Zlato Vlaska, he yet added that he would have to
	find her himself.</p>

	<p>He then led him to a large room and bade him choose
	from among the twelve charming girls who sat at a round
	table. Each wore a kind of linen head-dress that completely
	hid the upper part of the head, and in such a way
	that the keenest eye could not discover the colour of the
	hair.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page87" title="87">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Here are my daughters,&#8221; said the king, &#8220;but only one
	among them has golden hair. If you find her you may take
	her with you; but if you make a mistake she will remain with
	us, and you will have to return empty-handed.&#8221;</p>

	<p>George felt much embarrassed, not knowing what course
	to take.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Buzz, Buzz, come walk round these young girls, and I
	will tell you which is yours.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Thus spoke the fly whose life George had saved.</p>

	<p>Thus reassured he walked boldly round, pointing at them
	one after the other and saying, &#8220;This one has not the golden
	hair, nor this one either, nor this&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Suddenly, having been told by the fly, he cried, &#8220;Here we
	are: this is Zlato Vlaska, even she herself. I take her for my
	own, she whom I have won, and for whom I have paid the
	price with many cares. You will not refuse her me this time.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Indeed, you have guessed aright,&#8221; replied the king.</p>

	<p>The princess rose from her seat, and letting fall her head-dress,
	exposed to full view all the splendour of her wonderful
	hair, which seemed like a waterfall of golden rays, and covered
	her from head to foot. The glorious light that shone from it
	dazzled the young man&#8217;s eyes, and he immediately fell in love
	with her.</p>

	<p>The king provided his daughter with gifts worthy of a
	queen, and she left her father&#8217;s palace in a manner befitting a
	royal bride. The journey back was accomplished without any
	mishaps.</p>

	<p>On their arrival the old king was delighted at the sight of
	Zlato Vlaska, and danced with joy. Splendid and costly preparations
	were made for the wedding. His majesty then said
	<a class="pagenum" id="page88" title="88">&nbsp;</a>to George, &#8220;You robbed me of the secret of animal language.
	For this I intended to have your head cut off and your body
	thrown to birds of prey. But as you have served me so faithfully
	and won the princess for my bride I will lessen the
	punishment&#8212;that is, although you will be executed, yet you
	shall be buried with all the honours worthy of a superior
	officer.&#8221;</p>

	<p>So the sentence was carried out, cruelly and unjustly.
	After the execution the Princess with the Golden Hair begged
	the king to make her a present of George&#8217;s body, and the
	monarch was so much in love that he could not refuse his
	intended bride anything.</p>

	<p>Zlato Vlaska with her own hands replaced the head on
	the body, and sprinkled it with the Water of Death. Immediately
	the separated parts became one again. Upon this
	she poured the Water of Life, and George returned to life,
	fresh as a young roebuck, his face radiant with health and
	youth.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ah me! How well I have slept,&#8221; said he, rubbing his
	eyes.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Yes; no one could have slept better,&#8221; answered the
	princess, smiling, &#8220;but without me you would have slept
	through eternity.&#8221;</p>

		<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page90" title="90">&nbsp;</a>[Blank Page] -->
	</div>

	<p>When the old king saw George restored to life, and looking
	younger, handsomer, and more vigorous than ever, he
	too wanted to be made young again. He therefore ordered
	his servants to cut off his head and sprinkle it with the Life-Giving
	Water. They cut it off, but he did not come to life
	again, although they sprinkled his body with all the water
	that was left. Perhaps they made some mistake in using  <!-- Original location of pages 89 & 90 -->
	<a class="pagenum" id="page91" title="91">&nbsp;</a>the wrong water, for the head and body were joined, but life
	itself never returned, there being no Water of Life left for
	that purpose. No one knew where to get any, and none
	understood the language of animals.</p>

	<p>So, to make a long story short, George was proclaimed
	king, and the Princess with Hair of Gold, who really loved
	him, became his queen.</p>

	</div>

	<p class="second_title">THE JOURNEY TO THE SUN AND THE MOON</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">There</span> were once two young people who loved each
	other dearly. The young man was called Jean, the
	girl, Annette. In her sweetness she was like unto
	<a class="pagenum" id="page96" title="96">&nbsp;</a>a dove, in her strength and bravery she resembled an
	eagle.</p>

	<p>Her father was a rich farmer, and owned a large estate,
	but Jean&#8217;s father was only a poor mountain shepherd.
	Annette did not in the least mind her lover being poor,
	for he was rich in goodness: nor did she think her father
	would object to their marrying.</p>

	<p>One day Jean put on his best clothes, and went to ask
	the farmer for his daughter&#8217;s hand. The farmer listened
	without interrupting him, and then replied, &#8220;If you would
	marry Annette, go and ask of the Sun why he does not warm
	the night as well as the day. Then inquire of the Moon
	why she does not shine by day as well as by night. When
	you return with these answers you shall not only have my
	daughter but all my wealth.&#8221;</p>

	<p>These conditions in no way daunted Jean, who placed
	his hat on the side of his head, and taking a loving farewell
	of Annette, set out in search of the Sun. On reaching a
	small town at the close of day, he looked about for a place
	wherein to pass the night. Some kind people offered him
	shelter and invited him to sup with them, inquiring as to
	the object of his journey. When they heard that he was
	on his way to visit the Sun and Moon, the master of the
	house begged him to ask the Sun why the finest pear-tree
	they had in the town had, for several years, ceased to bear
	fruit, for it used to produce the most delicious pears in
	the world.</p>

	<p>Jean willingly promised to make this inquiry, and the
	next day continued his journey.</p>

	<p>He walked on and on, over mountain and moor, through
	<a class="pagenum" id="page97" title="97">&nbsp;</a>valley and dense forest, until he came to a land where
	there was no drinking water. The inhabitants, when they
	heard the object of Jean&#8217;s journey, begged him to ask the
	Sun and Moon why a well, that was the chief water supply
	of the district, no longer gave good water. Jean promised
	to do so, and resumed his journey.</p>

	<p>After long and weary wanderings he reached the Sun&#8217;s
	abode, and found him about to start on his travels.</p>

	<p>&#8220;O Sun,&#8221; said he, &#8220;stop one moment, do not depart
	without first answering a few questions.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Be quick then and speak, for I have to go all round
	the world to-day.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Pray tell me why you do not warm or light the earth
	by night as well as day?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;For this simple reason, that if I did, the world and
	everything upon it would be very soon burnt up.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Jean then put his questions concerning the pear-tree and
	the well. But the Sun replied that his sister, the Moon,
	would be able to answer him on those points.</p>

	<p>Hardly had the Sun finished speaking before he was
	obliged to hurry off, and Jean travelled far and fast to meet
	the Moon. On coming up to her he said, &#8220;Would you
	kindly stop one moment? there are a few questions I should
	like to ask you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Very well, be quick, for the earth is waiting for me,&#8221;
	answered she, and stood still at once.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Tell me, dear Moon, why you do not light the world by
	day as well as by night? And why you never warm it?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Because if I lit up the world by day as well as by night
	the plants would produce neither fruit nor flower. And
	<a class="pagenum" id="page98" title="98">&nbsp;</a>though I do not warm the earth, I supply it with dew, which
	makes it fertile and fruitful.&#8221;</p>

	<p>She was then about to continue her course, but Jean,
	begging her to stop one moment longer, questioned her about
	the pear-tree which had ceased to bear fruit.</p>

	<p>And she answered him thus: &#8220;While the king&#8217;s eldest
	daughter remained unmarried the tree bore fruit every year.
	After her wedding she had a little child who died and was
	buried under this tree. Since then there has been neither
	fruit nor flower on its branches: if the child be given
	Christian burial the tree will produce blossom and fruit as
	in the past.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The Moon was just moving off when Jean begged her to
	stop and answer one more question, which was, why the
	inhabitants of a certain land were unable to obtain from their
	well the clear and wholesome water it had formerly poured
	forth.</p>

	<p>She replied: &#8220;Under the mouth of the well, just where
	the water should flow, lies an enormous toad which poisons
	it continually: the brim of the well must be broken and
	the toad killed, then the water will be as pure and wholesome
	as formerly.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The Moon then resumed her journey, for Jean had no
	more questions to ask her.</p>

	<p>He joyfully went back to claim his Annette, but forgot
	not to stop on coming to the land where they were short of
	water. The inhabitants ran out to meet him, anxious to
	know what he had found out.</p>

	<div class="image"><a class="pagenum disguise" id="page99" title="99">&nbsp;</a>
		<a href="images/illo-19.png"><img src="images/illo-19-th.png" width="312" height="491" alt="A woman brings a rolled-up cloth to a man laden with other goods, while a king and crowd look on." /></a>
	<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page100" title="100">&nbsp;</a>[Blank Page] -->

	<p>Jean led them to the well and there explained the instructions
	he had received from the Moon, at the same time <!-- Original location of pages 99 & 100 -->
	<a class="pagenum" id="page101" title="101">&nbsp;</a>showing them what to do. Sure enough, right underneath
	the brim of the well they found a horrible toad which
	poisoned everything. When they had killed it, the water
	immediately became pure and transparent, and sweet to the
	taste as before.</p>

	<p>All the people brought Jean presents, and thus laden with
	riches he again set out. On arriving at the town where grew
	the unfruitful pear-tree, he was warmly welcomed by the
	prince, who at once asked if he had forgotten to question
	the stars about the tree.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I never forget a promise once made,&#8221; replied Jean, &#8220;but
	I doubt whether it will be agreeable to your majesty to know
	the cause of the evil.&#8221;</p>

	<p>He then related all the Moon had said, and when his
	directions had been carried out they were rewarded by seeing
	the tree blossom immediately. Jean was loaded with rich
	gifts, and the king presented him with a most valuable horse,
	by means of which he reached home very quickly.</p>

	<p>Little Annette was wild with joy on hearing of her lover&#8217;s
	safe return, for she had wept and suffered much during his
	absence. But her father&#8217;s feelings were very different; he
	wished never to see Jean again, and had, indeed, sent him
	in search of the Sun with the hope that he might be burnt
	up by the heat. True it is that &#8220;Man proposes and God
	disposes.&#8221; Our young shepherd returned, not only safe
	and sound, but with more knowledge than any of his evil-wishers.
	For he had learnt why the Sun neither lights nor
	warms the earth by night as in the day; also why the Moon
	does not give warmth, and only lights up during the night.
	Besides all this he had brought with him riches which far
	<a class="pagenum" id="page102" title="102">&nbsp;</a>exceeded those of his father-in-law, and a steed full of fire
	and vigour.</p>

	<p>So Annette&#8217;s father could find no fault, and the wedding
	was celebrated with joy and feasting. Large quantities of
	roasted crane were eaten, and glasses overflowing with mead
	were emptied. So beautiful, too, was the music, that for
	long, long after it was heard to echo among the mountains,
	and even now its sweet sounds are heard at times by travellers
	among those regions.</p>

	</div>

	<p class="second_title">THE DWARF WITH THE LONG BEARD</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">In</span> a far distant land there reigned a king, and he had an
	only daughter who was so very beautiful that no one in the
	whole kingdom could be compared to her. She was known
	as Princess Pietnotka, and the fame of her beauty spread
	far and wide. There were many princes among her suitors,
	but her choice fell upon Prince Dobrotek. She obtained
	her father&#8217;s consent to their marriage, and then, attended by
	<a class="pagenum" id="page106" title="106">&nbsp;</a>a numerous suite, set off with her lover for the church, having
	first, as was the custom, received her royal parent&#8217;s blessing.
	Most of the princes who had been unsuccessful in their wooing
	of Pietnotka returned disappointed to their own kingdoms:
	but one of them, a dwarf only seven inches high, with an
	enormous hump on his back and a beard seven feet long,
	who was a powerful prince and magician, was so enraged that
	he determined to have his revenge. So he changed himself
	into a whirlwind and lay in wait to receive the princess.
	When the wedding procession was about to enter the church
	the air was suddenly filled with a blinding cloud of dust, and
	Pietnotka was borne up high as the highest clouds, and then
	right down to an underground palace. There the dwarf, for
	it was he who had worked this spell, disappeared, leaving her
	in a lifeless condition.</p>

	<p>When she opened her eyes she found herself in such a
	magnificent apartment that she imagined some king must have
	run away with her. She got up and began to walk about,
	when lo! as if by some unseen hand the table was laden with
	gold and silver dishes, filled with cakes of every kind. They
	looked so tempting, that in spite of her grief she could not
	resist tasting, and she continued to eat until she was more
	than satisfied. She returned to the sofa and lay down to rest,
	but being unable to sleep, she looked first at the door, and
	then at the lamp burning on the table, then at the door again,
	and then back to the lamp. Suddenly the door opened of itself,
	giving entrance to four negroes fully armed, and bearing a
	golden throne, upon which was seated the Dwarf with the
	Long Beard. He came close up to the sofa and attempted to
	kiss the princess, but she struck him such a blow in the face
	<a class="pagenum" id="page107" title="107">&nbsp;</a>that a thousand stars swam before his eyes, and a thousand
	bells rang in his ears; upon which he gave such a shout, that
	the palace walls trembled. Yet his love for her was so great
	that he did his best not to show his anger, and turned away
	as if to leave her. But his feet became entangled in his long
	beard, and he fell down, dropping a cap he was carrying in his
	hand. Now this cap had the power of making its wearer
	invisible. The negroes hastened up to their master, and
	placing him on his throne bore him out.</p>

	<p>Directly the princess found herself alone she jumped off
	the sofa, locked the door, and picking up the cap ran to a
	mirror to try it on and see how it suited her. Imagine her
	amazement when looking in the glass she saw&#8212;nothing at all!
	She took off the cap, and behold, she was there again as large
	as life. She soon found out what sort of cap it was, and rejoicing
	in the possession of such a marvel, put it on her head
	again and began to walk about the room. Soon the door was
	burst violently open, and the dwarf entered with his beard tied
	up. But he found neither the princess nor the cap, and so
	came to the conclusion that she had taken it. In a great
	rage he began to search high and low; he looked under all the
	furniture, behind the curtains, and even beneath the carpets,
	but it was all in vain. Meanwhile the princess, still invisible,
	had left the palace and run into the garden, which was very
	large and beautiful. There she lived at her ease, eating the
	delicious fruit, drinking water from the fountain, and enjoying
	the helpless fury of the dwarf, who sought her untiringly.
	Sometimes she would throw the fruit-stones in his face, or
	take off the cap and show herself for an instant: then she
	would put it on again, and laugh merrily at his rage.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page108" title="108">&nbsp;</a>One day, while playing this game, the cap caught in the
	branches of a gooseberry bush. The dwarf seeing this at once
	ran up, seized the princess in one hand and the cap in the
	other, and was about to carry both off when the sound of a
	war-trumpet was heard.</p>

	<p>The dwarf trembled with rage and muttered a thousand
	curses. He breathed on the princess to send her to sleep,
	covered her with the invisible cap, and seizing a double-bladed
	sword, rose up in the air as high as the clouds, so that he
	might fall upon his assailant and kill him at one stroke. We
	shall now see with whom he had to deal.</p>

	<p>After the hurricane had upset the wedding procession and
	carried off the princess, there arose a great tumult among
	those at court. The king, the princess&#8217;s attendants, and
	Prince Dobrotek sought her in every direction, calling her
	by name, and making inquiries of every one they met. At
	last, the king in despair declared that if Prince Dobrotek did
	not bring back his daughter, he would destroy his kingdom
	and have him killed. And to the other princes present he
	promised that whosoever among them should bring Pietnotka
	back to him should have her for his wife and receive half
	of the kingdom. Whereupon they all mounted their horses
	without loss of time and dispersed in every direction.</p>

	<p>Prince Dobrotek, overpowered with grief and dismay, travelled
	three days without eating, drinking, or sleeping. On
	the evening of the third day he was quite worn-out with
	fatigue, and stopping his horse in a field, got down to rest for
	a short time. Suddenly he heard cries, as of something in
	pain, and looking round saw an enormous owl tearing a hare
	with its claws. The prince laid hold of the first hard thing
	<a class="pagenum" id="page109" title="109">&nbsp;</a>that came to his hand; he imagined it to be a stone, but it
	was really a skull, and aiming it at the owl, killed the bird
	with the first blow. The rescued hare ran up to him and
	gratefully licked his hands, after which it ran away: but the
	human skull spoke to him and said, &#8220;Prince Dobrotek, accept
	my grateful thanks for the good turn you have done me. I
	belonged to an unhappy man who took his own life, and for
	this crime of suicide I have been condemned to roll in the
	mud until I was the means of saving the life of one of God&#8217;s
	creatures. I have been kicked about for seven hundred and
	seventy years, crumbling miserably on the earth, and without
	exciting the compassion of a single individual. You have
	been the means of setting me free by making use of me to
	save the life of that poor hare. In return for this kindness
	I will teach you how to call to your aid a most marvellous
	horse, who during my life belonged to me. He will be able
	to help you in a thousand ways, and when in need of him
	you have only to walk out on the moorland without once
	looking behind you, and to say:</p>

	<div class="poem">
	<p>&#8216;Dappled Horse with Mane of Gold,</p>
	<p>Horse of Wonder! Come to me.</p>
	<p>Walk not the earth, for I am told</p>
	<p>You fly like birds o&#8217;er land and sea.&#8217;</p>
	</div>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">Finish your work of mercy by burying me here, so that I
	may be at rest until the day of judgment. Then depart in
	peace and be of good cheer.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The prince dug a hole at the foot of a tree, and reverently
	buried the skull, repeating over it the prayers for the dead.
	Just as he finished he saw a small blue flame come out of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page110" title="110">&nbsp;</a>the skull and fly towards heaven: it was the soul of the dead
	man on its way to the angels.</p>

	<p>The prince made the sign of the cross and resumed his
	journey. When he had gone some way along the moorland
	he stopped, and without looking back tried the effect of the
	magic words, saying:</p>


	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Dappled Horse with Mane of Gold,</p>
		<p>Horse of Wonder! Come to me.</p>
		<p>Walk not the earth, for I am told</p>
		<p>You fly like birds o&#8217;er land and sea.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>Then amid flash of lightning and roll of thunder appeared
	the horse. A horse, do I say? Why, he was a miracle of
	wonder. He was light as air, with dappled coat and golden
	mane. Flames came from his nostrils and sparks from his
	eyes. Volumes of steam rolled from his mouth and clouds
	of smoke issued from his ears. He stopped before the prince,
	and said in a human voice, &#8220;What are your orders, Prince
	Dobrotek?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am in great trouble,&#8221; answered the prince, &#8220;and shall
	be glad if you can help me.&#8221; Then he told all that had
	happened.</p>

	<p>And the horse said, &#8220;Enter in at my left ear, and come
	out at my right.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The prince obeyed, and came out at the right ear clad in
	a suit of splendid armour. His gilded cuirass, his steel helmet
	inlaid with gold, and his sword and club made of him a
	complete warrior. Still more, he felt himself endowed with
	superhuman strength and bravery. When he stamped his
	foot and shouted the earth trembled and gave forth a sound
	like thunder, the very leaves fell from the trees.</p>

	</div>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page113" title="113">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;What must we do? Where are we to go?&#8221; he asked.</p>

	<p>The horse replied, &#8220;Your bride, Princess Pietnotka, has
	been carried off by the Dwarf with the Long Beard, whose
	hump weighs two hundred and eighty pounds. This powerful
	magician must be defeated, but he lives a long way from here,
	and nothing can touch or wound him except the sharp
	smiting sword that belongs to his own brother, a monster
	with the head and eyes of a basilisk. We must first attack
	the brother.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Prince Dobrotek leaped on to the dappled horse, which
	was covered with golden trappings, and they set off immediately,
	clearing mountains, penetrating forests, crossing rivers;
	and so light was the steed&#8217;s step that he galloped over
	the grass without bending a single blade, and along sandy
	roads without raising a grain of dust. At last they reached
	a vast plain, strewn with human bones. They stopped in
	front of a huge moving mountain, and the horse said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Prince, this moving mountain that you see before you
	is the head of the Monster with Basilisk Eyes, and the bones
	that whiten the ground are the skeletons of his victims, so
	beware of the eyes that deal death. The heat of the midday
	sun has made the giant sleep, and the sword with the never-failing
	blade lies there before him. Bend down and lie along
	my neck until we are near enough, then seize the sword and
	you have nothing more to fear. For, without the sword, not
	only will the monster be unable to harm you, but he himself
	will be completely at your mercy.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The horse then noiselessly approached the huge creature,
	upon which the prince bent down, and quickly picked up the
	sword. Then, raising himself on his steed&#8217;s back, he gave a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page114" title="114">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; loud enough to wake the dead. The giant lifted
	his head, yawned, and turned his bloodthirsty eyes upon the
	prince; but seeing the sword in his hand he became quiet,
	and said, &#8220;Knight, is it weariness of life that brings you
	here?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Boast not,&#8221; replied the prince, &#8220;you are in my power.
	Your glance has already lost its magic charm, and you will
	soon have to die by this sword. But first tell me who
	you are.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;It is true, prince, I am in your hands, but be generous,
	I deserve your pity. I am a knight of the race of giants, and
	if it were not for the wickedness of my brother I should have
	lived in peace. He is the horrible dwarf with the great hump
	and the beard seven feet long. He was jealous of my fine
	figure, and tried to do me an injury. You must know that
	all his strength, which is extraordinary, lies in his beard, and
	it can only be cut off by the sword you hold in your hand.
	One day he came to me and said, &#8216;Dear brother, I pray you
	help me to discover the sharp smiting sword that has been
	hidden in the earth by a magician. He is our enemy, and
	he alone can destroy us both.&#8217; Fool that I was, I believed
	him, and by means of a large oak tree, raked up the mountain
	and found the sword. Then we disputed as to which of us
	should have it, and at last my brother suggested that we
	should cease quarrelling and decide by lot. &#8216;Let us each
	put an ear to the ground, and the sword shall belong to him
	who first hears the bells of yonder church,&#8217; said he. I placed
	my ear to the ground at once, and my brother treacherously
	cut off my head with the sword. My body, left unburied,
	became a great mountain, which is now overgrown with
	<a class="pagenum" id="page115" title="115">&nbsp;</a>forests. As for my head, it is full of a life and strength proof
	against all dangers, and has remained here ever since to
	frighten all who attempt to take away the sword. Now,
	prince, I beg of you, use the sword to cut off the beard of my
	wicked brother; kill him, and return here to put an end to
	me: I shall die happy if I die avenged.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That you shall be, and very soon, I promise you,&#8221;
	replied his listener.</p>

	<p>The prince bade the Dappled Horse with Golden Mane
	carry him to the kingdom of the Dwarf with the Long Beard.
	They reached the garden gate at the very moment when the
	dwarf had caught sight of Princess Pietnotka and was running
	after her. The war-trumpet, challenging him to fight, had
	obliged him to leave her, which he did, having first put on
	her head the invisible cap.</p>

	<p>While the prince was awaiting the answer to his challenge
	he heard a great noise in the clouds, and looking up saw the
	dwarf preparing to aim at him from a great height. But he
	missed his aim and fell to the ground so heavily that his
	body was half buried in the earth. The prince seized him
	by the beard, which he at once cut off with the sharp smiting
	sword.</p>

	<p>Then he fastened the dwarf to the saddle, put the beard
	in his helmet, and entered the palace. When the servants
	saw that he had really got possession of the terrible beard,
	they opened all the doors to give him entrance. Without
	losing a moment he began his search for Princess Pietnotka.
	For a long time he was unsuccessful, and was almost in
	despair when he came across her accidentally, and, without
	knowing it, knocked off the invisible cap. He saw his lovely
	<a class="pagenum" id="page116" title="116">&nbsp;</a>bride sound asleep, and being unable to wake her he put the
	cap in his pocket, took her in his arms, and, mounting his
	steed, set off to return to the Monster with the Basilisk
	Eyes. The giant swallowed the dwarf at one mouthful, and
	the prince cut the monster&#8217;s head up into a thousand pieces,
	which he scattered all over the plain.</p>

	<p>He then resumed his journey, and on coming to the moorland
	the dappled horse stopped short and said, &#8220;Prince, here
	for the present we must take leave of each other. You are
	not far from home, your own horse awaits you; but before
	leaving, enter in at my right ear and come out at my left.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The prince did so, and came out without his armour, and
	clad as when Pietnotka left him.</p>

	<p>The dappled horse vanished, and Dobrotek whistled to
	his own horse, who ran up, quite pleased to see him again.
	They immediately set off for the king&#8217;s palace.</p>

	<p>But night came on before they reached the end of their
	journey.</p>

	<p>The prince laid the sleeping maiden on the grass, and,
	covering her up carefully to keep her warm, he himself fell
	fast asleep. By chance, a knight, one of her suitors, passed
	that way. Seeing Dobrotek asleep he drew his sword and
	stabbed him; then he lifted the princess on his horse and
	soon reached the king&#8217;s palace, where he addressed Pietnotka&#8217;s
	father in these words: &#8220;Here is your daughter, whom
	I now claim as my wife, for it is I who have restored her to
	you. She was carried off by a terrible sorcerer who fought
	with me three days and three nights. But I conquered him,
	and I have brought you the princess safely back.&#8221;</p>

	<div class="image"><a class="pagenum disguise" id="page117" title="117">&nbsp;</a>
		<a href="images/illo-22.png"><img src="images/illo-22-th.png" width="331" height="494" alt="A princely man stands next to a sleeping princess." /></a>
		<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page118" title="118">&nbsp;</a>[Blank Page] -->
	</div>

	<p>The king was overjoyed at seeing her again, but finding  <!-- Original location of pages 117 & 118 -->
	<a class="pagenum" id="page119" title="119">&nbsp;</a>that his tenderest efforts were powerless to awake her, he
	wanted to know the reason of it.</p>

	<p>&#8220;That I cannot tell you,&#8221; replied the impostor; &#8220;you see
	her as I found her myself.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, poor Prince Dobrotek, seriously wounded,
	was slowly recovering consciousness, but he felt so weak that
	he could hardly utter these words:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Come, Magic Horse with Mane of Gold,</p>
		<p>Come, Dappled Horse, O come to me.</p>
		<p>Fly like the birds as you did of old,</p>
		<p>As flashes of lightning o&#8217;er land and sea.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>Instantly a bright cloud appeared, and from the midst
	thereof stepped the magic horse. As he already knew all
	that had happened, he dashed off immediately to the Mountain
	of Eternal Life. Thence he drew the three kinds of water:
	the Water that gives Life, the Water that Cures, and the Water
	that Strengthens. Returning to the prince, he sprinkled him
	first with the Life-giving Water, and instantly the body, which
	had become cold, was warm again and the blood began to
	circulate. The Water that Cures healed the wound, and the
	Strength-giving Water had such an effect upon him that he
	opened his eyes and cried out, &#8220;Oh, how well I have slept.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You were already sleeping the eternal sleep,&#8221; replied the
	dappled horse. &#8220;One of your rivals stabbed you mortally,
	and carried off Pietnotka, whom he pretends to have rescued.
	But do not worry yourself, she still sleeps, and none can
	arouse her but you, and this you must do by touching her
	with the dwarf&#8217;s beard. Go now, and be happy.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The brave steed disappeared in a whirlwind, and Prince
	<a class="pagenum" id="page120" title="120">&nbsp;</a>Dobrotek proceeded on his way. On drawing near the capital
	he saw it surrounded by a large foreign army; part of it was
	already taken, and the inhabitants seemed to be begging for
	mercy. The prince put on his invisible cap, and began to
	strike right and left with the sharp smiting sword. With such
	fury did he attack the enemy that they fell dead on all sides,
	like felled trees. When he had thus destroyed the whole
	army he went, still invisible, into the palace, where he heard
	the king express the utmost astonishment that the enemy had
	retired without fighting.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Where then is the brave warrior who has saved us?&#8221;
	said his majesty aloud.</p>

	<p>Every one was silent, when Dobrotek took off his magic
	cap, and falling on his knees before the monarch, said: &#8220;It is
	I, my king and father, who have routed and destroyed the
	enemy. It is I who saved the princess, my bride. While
	on my way back with her I was treacherously killed by my
	rival, who has represented himself to you as her rescuer, but
	he has deceived you. Lead me to the princess, that I may
	awaken her.&#8221;</p>

	<p>On hearing these words the impostor ran away as quickly
	as possible, and Dobrotek approached the sleeping maiden.
	He just touched her brow with the dwarf&#8217;s beard, upon
	which she opened her eyes, smiled, and seemed to ask where
	she was.</p>

	<p>The king, overcome with joy, kissed her fondly, and the
	same evening she was married to the devoted Prince Dobrotek.
	The king himself led her to the altar, and to his son-in-law he
	gave half his kingdom. So splendid was the wedding banquet,
	that eye has never seen, nor ear ever heard of its equal.</p>

	<p class="second_title">THE FLYING CARPET, THE INVISIBLE CAP,
	THE GOLD-GIVING RING, AND THE SMITING
	CLUB</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">In</span> a cottage near the high-road, and close to the shores of
	a large lake, there once lived a widow, poor and old. She
	was very very poor, but her mother&#8217;s heart was rich in pride
	in her son, who was the joy of her life. He was a handsome
	lad with an honest soul. He earned his living by fishing in
	the lake, and succeeded so well that neither he nor his mother
	<a class="pagenum" id="page124" title="124">&nbsp;</a>were ever in want of their daily bread. Every one called him
	&#8220;the fisherman.&#8221;</p>

	<p>One evening at dusk he went down to the lake to throw
	in his nets, and standing on the shore with a new bucket in
	his hand, waited to put into it whatever fish it might please
	God to send him. In about a quarter of an hour or so he
	drew in his nets and took out two bream. These he threw
	into the bucket, and humming a merry song turned to go
	home. At that moment a traveller, poorly clad, with hair
	and beard white as the wings of a dove, spoke to him, saying,
	&#8220;Have pity on a feeble old man, obliged to lean on his
	stick, hungry and ragged. I beg you, in Heaven&#8217;s name, to
	give me either money or bread. The sun will soon set, and
	I who have eaten nothing to-day shall have to pass the night
	fasting, with the bare earth for a bed.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;My good old friend, I am sorry I have nothing about
	me to give you, but you see the black smoke curling up
	in the distance? That is our cottage, where my old mother
	is waiting for me to bring her some fish to cook for our
	supper. Now take these two bream to her, meanwhile I will
	return to the lake and throw in my nets again to see if I can
	catch something more. Thus, with God&#8217;s help, we shall all
	three have enough for supper to-night and breakfast to-morrow
	morning.&#8221;</p>

	<p>While speaking the fisherman handed the fish to the old
	man, when, marvel of marvels! he melted into the rays of
	the setting sun and vanished, both he and the fish.</p>

	<p>The fisherman, much astonished, rubbed his eyes and
	looked about on all sides. For a moment he felt afraid,
	but when he had crossed himself all terror left him and he
	<a class="pagenum" id="page125" title="125">&nbsp;</a>went to draw in his nets by the light of the moon. And what
	do you think he found in them? It was neither a pike nor
	a trout, but a small fish with eyes of diamonds, fins of rainbow
	colour, and golden scales that shone and flashed like
	lightning.</p>

	<p>When he had spread his nets on the beach the fish began
	to talk to him in the language of men.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Do not kill me, young fisherman,&#8221; it said, &#8220;but accept
	in exchange for my life this golden ring. Every time you
	put it on your finger repeat these words:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8216;I conjure thee, O ring, who gold can give,</p>
		<p>In the name of the little fishling of gold,</p>
		<p>For the good of man, that man may live,</p>
		<p>And the honour of heaven, send, new or old,</p>
		<p>Little or much, as may be my need,</p>
		<p>Coins of the realm, let them fall like seed.&#8217;</p>
	</div>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">After uttering each of these words, a shower of gold pieces
	will fall.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The fisherman gladly accepted the ring, and freeing the
	miraculous fish from the net he threw it back into the water.
	As it fell, it shone in the air like a shooting star and then
	disappeared beneath the waves.</p>

	<p>On his way back he said to himself, &#8220;My mother and I
	will go to bed hungry to-night, without our fried fish, but to-morrow,
	when I have made the golden coins gleam in our
	humble cottage, all sorts of good things will find their way
	there, and we shall live like lords.&#8221;</p>

	<p>But things turned out very differently, for the first thing
	he saw on opening the door was the table covered with a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page126" title="126">&nbsp;</a>white cloth, and upon it a china soup-tureen in which lay the
	two bream freshly cooked.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Where did you get those fish from, dear mother?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I do not know myself,&#8221; replied she, &#8220;for I have neither
	cleaned them nor cooked them. Our table spread itself, the
	fish placed themselves upon it, and although they have been
	there an hour they do not get cold; any one might think they
	had just been taken off the fire. Come, let us eat them.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The widow and her son sat down, said grace, and after
	eating as much as they wanted went to bed.</p>

	<p>Next morning, at breakfast time, the fisherman made the
	sign of the cross, and then put on the gold ring, at the same
	time repeating the words the fish had taught him:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;I conjure thee, O ring, who gold can give,</p>
		<p>In the name of the little fishling of gold,</p>
		<p>For the good of man, that man may live,</p>
		<p>And the honour of heaven, send, new or old,</p>
		<p>Little or much, as may be my need,</p>
		<p>Coins of the realm, let them fall like seed.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>When he had ceased speaking the room was filled with a
	blast of wind followed by flashes of lightning, then a hailstorm
	of gold pieces showered down and quite covered the table.</p>

	<p>The chink of the money aroused his mother, who sat up
	in bed perfectly amazed.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What is the meaning of this, my son? Am I awake or
	dreaming? or is it the work of the Evil One? Where did all
	that money come from?&#8221;</p>

	</div>

	<p>&#8220;Fear not, mother, I wear a cross that charms away evil
	spirits. I have my work, so that you shall never want, and I  <!-- Original location of pages 127 & 128 -->
	<a class="pagenum" id="page129" title="129">&nbsp;</a>have your heart, where for me there will ever be love to
	sweeten the disappointments and troubles of life. This gold
	that you see will drive poverty far away, and enable us to help
	others. Take these pieces, lock them up safely, and use them
	when in need. As for me, kiss me, and wish me good luck
	on my journey.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What! Is it possible that you want to leave me already?
	Why? and whither are you going?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I want to go, mother mine, to see the great city. When
	there, I mean to enrol myself in the national army. Thus
	the fisherman turned soldier will become the defender of his
	king, for the glory of his country and his mother.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Of a truth, my son, I have heard some talk about the
	king being in danger, and that our enemies are trying to take
	his crown from him. But why should you go? Stay at home
	rather, for alone and unnoticed among so many troops you
	will neither be able to help nor to hinder.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You are right, one man alone is a small thing, but by
	adding one grain to another the measure overflows. If all
	those who are capable of bearing arms will help the king,
	there is no doubt that he will soon overcome his enemies.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;But a harmless fisherman like you! Of what use can
	you be in a battle?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;The fisherman has, doubtless, a peaceable disposition,
	and he never boasts of his strength. But when the right
	moment comes he knows how to handle a sword, and how
	to water the land with the enemy&#8217;s blood. And the victorious
	king will, perhaps, reward me for my bravery by giving me some
	splendid castle, or a few acres of forest land, a suit of armour
	and a horse, or even the hand of his daughter in marriage.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page130" title="130">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;If you feel like this,&#8221; answered she, &#8220;go, and may God
	bless you. May He cover you, dear child, with His grace as
	with a buckler, so that neither guns nor sabres shall do you
	harm. May He take you under His protection, so that you
	may return safe and sound to be a comfort to me; and at the
	end of my days may I rejoice in your happiness, and live near
	you as long as God in His wisdom shall allow.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then she gave him her blessing and kissed him tenderly,
	making the sign of the cross in the direction he was about
	to take.</p>

	<p>So he departed, and after a few days&#8217; march reached the
	capital, thinking within himself how he might help the king
	most effectually.</p>

	<p>The town was surrounded by a countless host who
	threatened to utterly destroy it unless the king would agree
	to pay a very large ransom.</p>

	<p>The people crowded into the square, and stood before the
	palace gates listening to the herald&#8217;s proclamation.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Hear the king&#8217;s will,&#8221; said the herald; &#8220;listen, all ye
	faithful subjects, to the words he speaks to you by my mouth.
	Here are our deadly enemies, who have scattered our troops,
	and have come to besiege the capital of our kingdom. If
	we do not send them, by daybreak to-morrow, twenty-four
	waggons, each drawn by six horses and loaded with gold, they
	threaten to take the town and destroy it by fire and sword,
	and to deliver our land to the soldiers. It is certain that we
	cannot hold out any longer, and our royal treasure-house
	does not contain one-half the amount demanded. Therefore,
	through me our sovereign announces, that whosoever among
	you shall succeed, either in defeating our foes, or in providing
	<a class="pagenum" id="page131" title="131">&nbsp;</a>the money needed for the ransom, him will he appoint his
	heir to the crown, and to him will he give his only daughter
	in marriage, a princess of marvellous beauty. Further, he
	shall receive half the kingdom in his own right.&#8221;</p>

	<p>When the fisherman heard these words he went to the
	king and said, &#8220;My sovereign and father, command that
	twenty-four waggons, each harnessed with twenty-four horses
	and provided with leathern bags, be brought into the courtyard;
	I will engage to fill them with gold, and that at once,
	before your eyes.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then he left the palace, and standing in the middle of the
	large square, recited the words the fish had taught him.</p>

	<p>These were followed by rumblings of thunder and flashes
	of lightning, and then by a perfect hurricane which sent down
	masses and showers of gold. In a few minutes the square
	was covered with a layer of gold so thick that, after loading
	the twenty-four waggons and filling a large half of the royal
	treasure-house, there was enough left to make handsome
	presents to all the king&#8217;s officers and servants.</p>

	<p>Next day the enemy returned to their own country laden
	with the heavy ransom they had demanded.</p>

	<p>The king sent for the fisherman, and inviting him to partake
	of hydromel wine and sweetmeats, said, &#8220;You have to-day
	been the means of saving our capital from a great calamity,
	and shall, therefore, receive the reward which you have earned.
	My only daughter, a princess of great beauty, shall be your
	wife, and I will give you the half of my kingdom for a wedding
	present. I also appoint you my heir to the throne. But tell
	me, to whom am I indebted? What kingdom or land belongs
	to you? How is it that by a mere movement of the hand
	<a class="pagenum" id="page132" title="132">&nbsp;</a>you were able to supply my enemies with such a quantity of
	gold?&#8221;</p>

	<p>And the fisherman, simple-hearted and straightforward as a
	child, ignorant of the deceptions practised in court, answered
	frankly, &#8220;Sire, I belong to no royal or princely family, I am
	a simple fisherman and your loyal subject. I procure my
	gold by means of this magic ring, and at any time I can have
	as much as I want.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then he told how his good fortune had come to him.</p>

	<p>The king made no answer, but it hurt his royal dignity to
	think that he owed his safety to one of his own peasants,
	and that he had promised to make him his son-in-law.</p>

	<p>That evening, after a luxurious supper, the fisherman,
	having taken a little more wine than usual, ventured to ask
	the king to present him to his bride. The king whispered a
	few words in the ear of the chamberlain of the court, and then
	went out.</p>

	<p>The chamberlain took the fisherman to the top of the
	castle tower, and there said to him, &#8220;According to the customs
	of the court you should, before being introduced to the
	princess, send her by my hands some valuable jewel as a
	wedding gift.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;But I have nothing of value or beauty about me,&#8221; replied
	he, &#8220;unless you offer the princess this golden ring, to which I
	owe all my good fortune, the princess herself, and the safety
	of her father.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The chamberlain took the ring, and opening the window
	of the tower, asked, &#8220;Fisherman, do you see the moon in the
	heavens?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I do.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page133" title="133">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Very well, she shall be the witness of your betrothal.
	Now look down; do you see that precipice, and the deep
	river shining in its depths.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I do.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Very well, it shall be your bridal couch.&#8221;</p>

	<p>So saying the chamberlain threw him into the deep abyss,
	shut the window, and ran to tell the king that there was no
	longer a suitor for the hand of his daughter.</p>

	<p>The fisherman, stunned by the force of his fall, reached
	the water quite senseless. When he came to himself and
	opened his eyes, he lay in a boat which at that moment was
	leaving the mouth of the river and entering the open sea.</p>

	<p>The very old man, to whom he had given the bream, was
	guiding the vessel with an oar.</p>

	<p>&#8220;My good old man, is it you? How did you manage to
	save me?&#8221; asked the astonished fisherman.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I came to your assistance,&#8221; replied the old man, &#8220;because
	he who shows pity to others deserves their help when in need
	of it. But take the oar and row to whatever place you wish.&#8221;</p>

	<p>And having thus spoken the mysterious old man disappeared.
	The fisherman crossed himself, and having looked
	round upon the royal palace sparkling with light he sighed deeply,
	and chanting the hymn &#8220;Under Thy Help,&#8221; put out to sea.</p>

	<p>When the sun rose he saw some nets in the boat, and
	throwing them into the water caught some pike, which he sold in
	a town near the shore, and then continued his journey on foot.</p>

	<p>Two or three months later, when crossing some open
	country, he heard cries for help which came from a hill near
	the forest. There he saw two little demons pulling each
	other&#8217;s hair. By the cut of their short waistcoats, by their
	<a class="pagenum" id="page134" title="134">&nbsp;</a>tight pantaloons and three-cornered hats, he knew that they
	were inhabitants of the nether world, from which they must
	have escaped. He had no doubt about it, but being a good
	Christian he was not afraid, and accosted them boldly, saying,
	&#8220;Why do you ill-treat each other in this way? What is the
	meaning of it?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;It means, that for many a long year we have both been
	working hard to entice a silly fellow down below. He was
	first tempted by the desire to learn something of sorcery, and
	he ended by becoming an accomplished scoundrel. After
	giving him time to commit a great many crimes and thus
	forfeit his soul, we handed him over to safe keeping. Now we
	want to divide his property between us. He has left three
	things, which by every right belong to us. The first is a
	wonderful carpet. Whoever sits down upon it, and pronounces
	certain magic words, will be carried off at once, over
	forests and under clouds, never stopping until his destination
	is reached. The magic words are as follows:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8216;Carpet, that of thyself through space takes flight,</p>
		<p>O travel, thou airy car, both day and night</p>
		<p>Till my desired haven comes in sight.&#8217;</p>
	</div>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">The second piece of property is that club lying on the grass.
	After uttering some magic words, the club will immediately
	begin to hit so vigorously that a whole army may be crushed
	to pieces or dispersed. The words run thus:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8216;Club, thou marvellous club, who knows</p>
		<p>How to strike and smite my foes,</p>
		<p>By thine own strength and in God&#8217;s name</p>
		<p>O strike well home and strike again.&#8217;</p>
	</div>

	<p class="continued_paragraph"><a class="pagenum" id="page135" title="135">&nbsp;</a>The third piece of property is a cap that renders its wearer
	invisible. Now, my good man, you see our difficulty: there
	are but two of us, and we are fighting to decide how these
	three lots may be divided into two equal parts.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I can help you,&#8221; said the fisherman, &#8220;provided you will
	do as I tell you. Leave the three lots here just as they are&#8212;the
	carpet, the club, and the magic cap. I will roll a stone
	from the top of this hill to the bottom&#8212;whoever catches it
	first shall have two lots for his share. What do you say?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Agreed!&#8221; cried the demons, racing after the stone that
	rolled and bounded on its way down.</p>

	<p>In the meantime the fisherman hastily put on the cap,
	seized the club, and sitting down on the carpet, repeated the
	magic formula without forgetting a single word.</p>

	<p>He was already high up in the air when the demons returned
	carrying the stone and calling out to him to come
	and reward the winner.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Come down and divide those things between us,&#8221; they
	cried after him.</p>

	<p>The fisherman&#8217;s only answer was the magic address to
	his club. This enchanted weapon then fell upon them and
	struck so hard that the country round echoed to the sound
	thereof. In the midst of screams and cries and clouds of
	dust they escaped at last, and the club, of its own accord,
	came back and placed itself at the fisherman&#8217;s orders. He,
	in spite of the rapid motion, sat comfortably on the carpet
	with the cap under his arm and the club in his hand. Thus
	they flew over forests, under clouds, and so high that seen
	from the earth they looked like a tiny white cloud.</p>

	<p>Within two or three days they stopped at the king&#8217;s
	<a class="pagenum" id="page136" title="136">&nbsp;</a>capital. The fisherman, with his cap on, descended into
	the middle of the courtyard.</p>

	<p>The whole place was in confusion and trouble, for the
	commander of the foreign army, encouraged by having so
	easily received such a large sum of money, had returned to
	the attack and again held the town in siege, declaring that
	he would destroy every house and slay all the inhabitants,
	not sparing even the king himself, unless he agreed to give
	him his only daughter in marriage.</p>

	<p>The terrified citizens crowded to the palace and besought
	his majesty to do as they asked him, and so save them from
	such a fate. The king, standing on the balcony, addressed
	them thus: &#8220;Faithful and devoted people, listen to me.
	Nothing but a miracle can save us from this fearful calamity;
	yet it has happened that the most powerful assailants have
	been forced to ask mercy of the most feeble. I will never
	consent to the marriage of my only daughter with my most
	hated and cruel foe. Within a few moments my guards will
	be ready for combat, and I myself will lead them against the
	enemy. If there be any among you who can win the victory,
	to him will I give my only daughter in marriage, the half of
	my kingdom for her dowry, and the heirship to the throne.&#8221;</p>

	<p>When he had finished speaking the fisherman ordered his
	club to fall on the foe, while the country round echoed and
	re-echoed to the blows by means of which it destroyed the
	besieging army. It was in vain that the brave commander
	shouted to his soldiers not to run away, for when he himself
	received three blows from the club he was obliged to make
	off as fast as possible.</p>

	<div class="image"><a class="pagenum disguise" id="page137" title="137">&nbsp;</a>

		<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page138" title="138">&nbsp;</a>[Blank Page] -->
	</div>

	<p>When the club had destroyed or driven away into the  <!-- Original location of pages 137 & 138 -->
	<a class="pagenum" id="page139" title="139">&nbsp;</a>desert all the troops it came back to its master; he, still
	wearing the magic cap, and with his carpet folded up under
	his arm and his club in his hand, made his way to the king&#8217;s
	apartment.</p>

	<p>In the palace shouts of joy had succeeded the cries of fear
	which had been heard but a short while ago. Every one was
	happy, and every one congratulated the king upon his victory,
	as sudden and complete as it was unexpected. But the
	monarch, turning to his warriors, addressed them thus:
	&#8220;Victory! Let us rather return thanks to God. He who
	has won for us the victory has but to present himself and
	receive the reward he so richly deserves, that is, my beautiful
	daughter in marriage, the half of my kingdom, and the right
	of succession to my throne. These are the gifts that await
	this victorious hero. Where is he?&#8221;</p>

	<p>They all stood silent and looked from one to the other.
	Then the fisherman, who had taken off his cap, appeared
	before the assembly and said, &#8220;Behold, it was I who destroyed
	your enemies, O king. This is the second time that I have
	been promised the hand of the princess in marriage, the half
	of the kingdom, and the right of succession to the throne.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The king, struck dumb with amazement, looked inquiringly
	at his chamberlain, then recovering his presence of mind he
	shook hands with the fisherman.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Your good health, my friend. By what happy fortune
	do you return safe and sound to my court? The chamberlain
	told me that through your own carelessness you had fallen
	out of the tower window; in truth, we mourned you as dead.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I should not have fallen out of the window if I had not
	been thrown down by your chamberlain; there is the traitor.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page140" title="140">&nbsp;</a>I only escaped death through God&#8217;s help, and I have just
	come to the palace in my air-car.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The king made a pretence of being angry with the guilty
	chamberlain, and ordered his guards to take him away to the
	donjon cell; then, with pretended friendship, he embraced
	the fisherman and led him to his own apartments. All the
	while he was thinking and thinking what he could do to get
	rid of him. The idea of having him, a mere peasant and one
	of his own subjects, for a son-in-law was most repugnant to
	him, and hurt his kingly pride. At last he said, &#8220;The chamberlain
	will most certainly be punished for his crime. As for
	you, who have twice been my saviour, you shall be my son-in-law.
	Now the customs observed at court demand that you
	should send your bride a wedding gift, a jewel, or some other
	trifle of value. When this has been observed I promise to
	give my blessing on the marriage, and may you both be happy
	and live long.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I have no jewel worthy of the princess&#8217;s acceptance. I
	might have given her as much gold as she wished, but your
	chamberlain took my magic golden ring from me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Before insisting upon its return something else might
	be done. I thoroughly appreciate the value of your marvellous
	flying carpet&#8212;why should not we both sit on it and make
	an excursion to the Valley of Diamonds? There we can
	obtain stones of the finest water, such as no one in the world
	has ever possessed. Afterwards we will return here with your
	wedding present for my daughter.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The king then opened the window, and the fisherman,
	spreading out his carpet, repeated the magic words.</p>

	<p>Thus they took flight into the air, and after travelling one
	<a class="pagenum" id="page141" title="141">&nbsp;</a>or two hours began to descend at their destination. It was
	a valley surrounded on all sides by rocks so steep and so
	difficult of access, that, except by God&#8217;s special grace, no
	mortal man imprisoned there could possibly escape. The
	ground was strewn with diamonds of the finest quality. The
	king and fisherman found it easy to make a large collection,
	picking and choosing, gathering and arranging them upon the
	carpet. When they had put together all there was room for,
	the king sat down, and pointing to a large diamond shining
	at a little distance, said to the fisherman, &#8220;There is yet a
	more splendid one by the stream yonder; run, my son-in-law,
	and bring it here, it would be a pity to leave it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The man went for it, while the king, taking advantage of
	his absence to pronounce the magic words, seated himself on
	the carpet, which lifted itself up, and floating like an air-car
	above the forest and under the clouds, descended by one of
	the palace windows.</p>

	<p>His joy knew no bounds, for he now found himself not
	only free from his enemies and rid of the embarrassing
	presence of the fisherman, but also the possessor of the
	richest and most beautiful collection of diamonds in the
	world;&#8212;by his orders they were put away in the caves of
	the royal treasure-house, and with them the magic ring and
	the flying carpet.</p>

	<p>Meantime the fisherman had returned with the diamond,
	and had stood aghast to see the carpet vanishing away in
	the distance.</p>

	<p>Wounded at the ingratitude and indignant at the perversity
	of a prince for whom he had done so much, he burst
	into tears.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page142" title="142">&nbsp;</a>And, indeed, he had good reason to weep. For he had
	but to look at the enormous height of the polished rocks to
	be convinced of the impossibility of climbing them. The
	vegetation, too, was so scanty that it could only provide him
	with food for a very short time. He saw but two courses
	open to him: either to die from starvation, or to be devoured
	by the monstrous serpents that crawled about in great numbers.
	Night was now coming on, and the poor fellow was obliged to
	plan some way of escaping the frightful reptiles which were
	leaving their hiding-places. At last he climbed up a tree, the
	highest he could find, and there, with his magic cap on and
	his club in his hand, passed the night without even closing
	his eyes.</p>

	<p>Next morning when the sun rose the serpents went back
	to their holes, and the fisherman got down from his tree
	feeling stiff with cold and very hungry. For some time he
	walked about the valley in search of food, turning over the
	diamonds now so useless to him. There he found a few
	worthless mushrooms, and with such poor food as berries
	and sorrel leaves, and the water of the valley stream for
	drink, he lived for some days.</p>

	<p>One night when he went to sleep it happened that his cap
	came off and fell to the ground, whereupon all the reptiles of
	the place immediately gathered round him. Aroused by their
	hisses, he awoke to find himself surrounded on all sides and
	almost in reach of their stings. He immediately seized his
	club, and had scarcely begun to repeat the magic formula
	before the weapon set to work to destroy the snakes, while the
	rocks resounded right and left with the blows. It was as if
	the monsters were being covered with boiling water, and the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page143" title="143">&nbsp;</a>noise they made was like that produced by a flock of birds
	overtaken by a storm. They roared and hissed and twisted
	themselves into a thousand knots, gradually disappearing one
	by one. Then the club returned of its own accord to the
	fisherman&#8217;s hands, while he returned thanks to God for
	having delivered him from such a horrible death. At that
	moment there appeared upon the top of a steep rock his
	friend, the old man. Overcome with joy at the sight of him,
	the fisherman called out, &#8220;Save me! come to me, my divine
	protector.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The old man spread out his arms towards him, and
	having blessed him drew him up, saying, &#8220;Now you are
	free again, hasten to save your king, his daughter your bride,
	and their kingdom. After he had left you in the valley as
	food for serpents he was punished for his great crimes by
	the return of the enemy, who again laid siege to the capital.
	This happened at the very moment when he was surrounded
	by his guests, and was boasting of his possession of the air-car,
	the magic golden ring, and the rest of his evilly acquired
	riches.</p>

	<p>&#8220;His foes had consulted Yaga, a wicked sorceress; she
	advised them to obtain the help of Kostey the magician, who
	promised his aid in carrying off the princess. When he came
	he fell in love with the beautiful maiden at first sight, and
	determined to marry her himself. In order to bring this
	about he threw the king, the courtiers, and all the inhabitants
	of the land into a heavy sleep. Then he bore off the princess
	to his own palace, where she has been shut up and ill-treated
	because she refuses to have anything to do with him. His
	castle is situated at the very end of the world, to the west.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page144" title="144">&nbsp;</a>There is nothing to hinder you from taking possession of
	your carpet and ring, they are hidden in the king&#8217;s treasure-house.
	Then go with your cap and club and conquer Kostey,
	rescue the princess, and deliver the king and his subjects.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The fisherman would have thrown himself at the old
	man&#8217;s feet to pour out his gratitude, but he suddenly vanished.
	So he thanked God for all His mercies, put on his invisible
	cap, and taking his club, made his way towards the capital.</p>

	<p>At the end of three days he entered the royal city. All
	the inhabitants were sleeping the enchanted sleep, from which
	they were powerless to rouse themselves. The fisherman
	went straight to the royal treasure-house, took the magic ring
	and carpet, then seating himself upon the latter and repeating
	the magic words, away he went like a bird, over rustling forests
	and under clouds, floating across the blue sky.</p>

	<p>After some days of travel he alighted in Kostey&#8217;s courtyard.
	Without a moment&#8217;s delay he folded up his carpet,
	put the magic cap on his head, and with club in hand entered
	Kostey&#8217;s room. There, to his astonishment, stood the magician
	himself, admiring the wondrous beauty of the princess.
	For she was perfectly beautiful; eye had never seen nor ear
	heard of such loveliness. With a low bow full of pride and
	an ironical smile he was saying to her: &#8220;Beauteous princess,
	you have sworn a most solemn oath to marry none but that
	man who can solve your six riddles. It is in vain that I strive
	to guess them. Now there are only two courses open to you:
	either to release yourself from your vow, putting the riddles
	aside and consenting to be my wife; or to persist in your
	vow and thus deliver yourself up to my anger, which you
	will bitterly regret. I give you three minutes to decide.&#8221;</p>

	<div class="image"><a class="pagenum disguise" id="page145" title="145">&nbsp;</a>
		<a href="images/illo-26.png"><img src="images/illo-26-th.png" width="314" height="490" alt="A woman sleeps in a chair; there's the merest outline of a man in the background." /></a>
		<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page146" title="146">&nbsp;</a>[Blank Page] -->
	</div>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page147" title="147">&nbsp;</a>Upon hearing these threats the fisherman trembled with
	rage, and in a low voice whispered the magic words to his
	club.</p>

	<p>This good weapon did not wait for the order to be
	repeated, but with one bound came down full upon Kostey&#8217;s
	forehead. Stunned for a moment by the violence of the
	blow, the terrible creature rolled upon the ground. Sparks
	like fireworks sprang from his eyes, and the noise as of
	a hundred mills seemed to go through his head. Any
	ordinary mortal would never have opened his eyes again,
	but Kostey was immortal.</p>

	<p>Getting on his feet he pulled himself together, and
	tried to find out who had thus attacked him. Then the
	club began to hit him again, and the sound thereof was
	like unto blows on an empty vault. It seemed to the
	magician as if showers of boiling water were being poured
	upon him. He twisted himself about in awful convulsions,
	and would have liked to bury himself in his palace walls
	and be turned to stone.</p>

	<p>At last, crippled with wounds, he began to hiss like a
	serpent, and springing forwards breathed upon the princess,
	filling the air with the poisonous blast.</p>

	<p>The maiden tottered and fell, as if dead. Kostey
	changed himself into a wreath of smoke, and floating out
	of the window, disappeared in a hurricane.</p>

	<p>The fisherman, still invisible, carried the princess into
	the courtyard of the castle, hoping that the fresh air might
	restore her to consciousness. He laid her upon the grass,
	his heart throbbing with hope and fear, and waited anxiously.
	Suddenly a raven and his nestlings, attracted by the sight
	<a class="pagenum" id="page148" title="148">&nbsp;</a>of a dead body, and not being able to see the fisherman,
	came by croaking. The parent bird said to his young ones:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Come, children, sharpen claws and beak, krâk, krâk,</p>
		<p>For here&#8217;s a feast not far to seek, krâk, krâk,</p>
		<p>This young girl&#8217;s corse so white and sleek, krâk, krâk.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>One small bird at once settled down on the princess,
	but the fisherman seized it and took off his cap, so that
	he could be seen.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Fisherman,&#8221; said the father raven, &#8220;let go my dear
	birdling and I will give you anything you want.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Then bring me some of the Life-Giving Water.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The raven flew away and returned in about an hour,
	carrying in his beak a tiny bottle of the water. Then he
	again begged to have his nestling back.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You shall have it as soon as I have proved that the
	water is of the right sort.&#8221;</p>

	<p>So saying, he sprinkled the pale face of the princess.
	She sighed, opened her eyes, and blushing at the sight of
	a stranger, got up and said, &#8220;Where am I? Why, how
	soundly I have slept!&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Lovely princess, your sleep might have lasted for
	ever.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then he told her his story, how he had been thrown into
	the river, abandoned in the Valley of Diamonds, and so
	on, relating at full length all the marvellous events that
	had taken place.</p>

	<p>She listened attentively, then, thanking him for all he
	had done for her, placed her hand in his and said, &#8220;In
	the garden behind the palace is an apple-tree that bears
	<a class="pagenum" id="page149" title="149">&nbsp;</a>golden fruit. A guzla that plays of its own accord hangs
	on its branches, and is guarded day and night by four
	negroes. Now the music from this guzla has the wonderful
	power of restoring health to invalids who listen to it, and
	happiness to those who are sad. That which is ugly becomes
	beautiful, and charms and enchantments of all kinds
	are broken and destroyed for ever.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The fisherman put on his invisible cap and went into
	the garden in search of the negroes. Before going up to
	them he addressed the magic words to his golden ring, and
	after a short thunderstorm a shower of gold covered the
	ground. The negroes, greedy of wealth, threw themselves
	upon it, snatching from each other handfuls of the golden
	rain. While thus engaged the fisherman unhooked the guzla
	from the branches and hurried off into the courtyard with it.
	There he unfolded his carpet, and sitting down upon it with
	the princess at his side, flew high up into the air. He had
	not forgotten to bring with him the cap, the club, and the
	ring; the princess took care of the guzla.</p>

	<p>They floated across the blue sky, above the rustling forests
	and under the clouds, and in a few days arrived at the palace.
	There they descended, but the people still lay wrapped in
	the enchanted sleep, from which they seemed to have no
	power of awakening.</p>

	<p>The silence of the tomb reigned around. Some of the
	officers were sitting, others standing, all motionless and rigid,
	and each one in the position he occupied when last awake.
	The king held a goblet filled with wine, for he had been
	giving a toast. The chamberlain had his throat half filled
	with a lying tale, which there had been no time to finish.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page150" title="150">&nbsp;</a>One had the end of a joke upon his lips, another a dainty
	morsel between his teeth, or a tale ready cooked upon his
	tongue.</p>

	<p>And it was the same in all the villages throughout the
	length and breadth of the land. All the inhabitants lay
	under the enchanted spell. The labourer held his whip in
	the air, for he had been about to strike his oxen. The
	harvesters with their sickles had stopped short in their work.
	The shepherds slept by their sheep in the middle of the road.
	The huntsman stood with the powder still alight on the pan
	of his gun. The birds, arrested in their flight, hung in mid-air.
	The animals in the woods were motionless. The water
	in the streams was still. Even the wind slept. Everywhere
	men had been overtaken in their occupations or amusements.
	It was a soundless land, without voice or movement; on all
	sides calm, death, sleep.</p>

	<p>The fisherman stood with the princess at his side in
	the banqueting-hall where slept the king and his guests.
	Taking the magic guzla from the maid, he pronounced these
	words:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;O guzla, play, and let thy sweetest harmonies resound</p>
		<p>Through hall and cot, o&#8217;er hill and dale, and all the country round;</p>
		<p>That by the power and beauty of thy heavenly tones and song</p>
		<p>Awakened may these sleepers be who sleep too well, too long.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>When the first tones of music burst forth everything began
	to move and live again. The king finished proposing his
	toast. The chamberlain ended his tale. The guests continued
	to feast and enjoy themselves. The servants waited
	<a class="pagenum" id="page151" title="151">&nbsp;</a>at their posts. In short, everything went on just as before,
	and as if nothing had happened to interrupt it.</p>

	<p>And it was just the same in all the country round.
	Everything suddenly awoke to life. The labourer finished
	ploughing his furrow. The haymakers built up the hay in
	ricks. The reapers cut down the golden grain. The hunter&#8217;s
	gun went off and shot the duck. The trees rustled. The
	gardener went on with his work and his song. The rich,
	who thought only of enjoyment, entertained one another in
	luxury and splendour.</p>

	<p>Now when the king caught sight of his daughter leaning
	on the fisherman&#8217;s arm he could hardly believe his own eyes,
	and it made him very angry. But the princess ran to him,
	and throwing herself in his arms, related all that he had
	accomplished. The monarch&#8217;s heart was softened, and he
	felt ashamed. With tears in his eyes he drew the fisherman
	towards him, and before the assembled company thanked him
	for having the third time saved his life.</p>

	<p>&#8220;God has punished me for my ill-treatment of you,&#8221; said
	he. &#8220;Yet He is generous and forgives; I will fulfil all your
	wishes.&#8221;</p>

	<p>He then added that the wedding feast should be held
	that very day, and that his only daughter would be married
	to the fisherman.</p>

	<p>The princess was filled with gladness, and standing with
	her father&#8217;s arms round her, said, &#8220;I cannot, however, break
	my word. When in Kostey&#8217;s palace I made a vow to bestow
	my hand only on that man who should guess the six riddles
	I put to him. I am sure the heroic man, who has done so
	much, will not refuse to submit to this last trial for my sake.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page152" title="152">&nbsp;</a>To this the fisherman bowed a willing assent.</p>

	<p>The first riddle was: &#8220;Without legs it walks. Without
	arms it strikes. Without life it moves continually.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;A clock,&#8221; he answered promptly, and to the great satisfaction
	of the princess, to whom this good beginning seemed
	to presage a happy ending.</p>

	<p>The second riddle ran thus: &#8220;Without being either bird,
	reptile, insect, or any animal whatsoever, it ensures the safety
	of the whole house.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;A bolt,&#8221; said her lover.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Good! Now this is the third: &#8216;Who is that pedestrian
	who walks fully armed, seasons dishes, and in his sides has
	two darts? He swims across the water without the help of
	a boatman.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;A lobster.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The princess clapped her hands and begged him to guess
	the fourth.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It runs, it moves along on two sides, it has but one eye,
	an overcoat of polished steel, and a tail of thread.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;A needle.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well guessed. Now listen to the fifth: &#8216;It walks
	without feet, beckons without hands, and moves without a
	body.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;It must be a shadow.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said she, well pleased. &#8220;Now you have
	succeeded so well with these five you will soon guess the
	sixth: &#8216;It has four feet, but is not an animal. It is provided
	with feathers and down, but is no bird. It has a body, and
	gives warmth, but is not alive.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;It is certainly a bed,&#8221; exclaimed the fisherman.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page153" title="153">&nbsp;</a>The princess gave him her hand. They both knelt at
	the king&#8217;s feet and received his fatherly blessing, after which
	he with a large wedding party accompanied them to the
	church. At the same time messengers were sent to bring
	the fisherman&#8217;s mother to the palace.</p>

	<p>The marvellous guzla played the sweetest music at the
	marriage feast, while the old king ate and drank and enjoyed
	himself, and danced like a madman. He treated his guests
	with so much kindness and generosity that to this very hour
	the happiness of those who were present is a thing to be
	talked about and envied.</p>

	<p>Now you see what it is to love virtue and pursue it with
	energy and courage. For by so doing a mere peasant, a poor
	simple fisherman, married the most lovely and enchanting
	princess in the whole world. He received, besides, half the
	kingdom on his wedding day, and the right of succession to
	the throne after the old king&#8217;s death.</p>

	<p class="second_title">THE BROAD MAN, THE TALL MAN, AND
	THE MAN WITH EYES OF FLAME</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">In</span> those days the king of a certain country had a daughter,
	who was not only exceedingly beautiful but also remarkably
	clever. Many kings and princes travelled from far distant
	lands, each one with the hope of making her his wife. But
	<a class="pagenum" id="page158" title="158">&nbsp;</a>she would have nothing to do with any one of them. Finally,
	it was proclaimed that she would marry that man who for
	three successive nights should keep such strict watch upon
	her that she could not escape unnoticed. Those who failed
	were to have their heads cut off.</p>

	<p>The news of this offer was noised about in all parts of
	the world. A great many kings and princes hastened to
	make the trial, taking their turn and keeping watch. But
	each one lost his life in the attempt, for they could not prevent,
	indeed they were not even able to see, the princess take
	her flight.</p>

	<p>Now it happened that Matthias, prince of a royal city,
	heard of what was going on and resolved to watch through
	the three nights. He was young, handsome as a deer, and
	brave as a falcon. His father did all he could to turn him
	from his purpose: he used entreaties, prayers, threats, in fact
	he forbade him to go, but in vain, nothing could prevent him.
	What could the poor father do? Worn-out with contention,
	he was at last obliged to consent. Matthias filled his purse
	with gold, girded a well-tried sword to his side, and quite
	alone started off to seek the fortune of the brave.</p>

	<p>Walking along next day, he met a man who seemed hardly
	able to drag one leg after the other.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Whither are you going?&#8221; asked Matthias.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am travelling all over the world in search of happiness.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What is your profession?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I have no profession, but I can do what no one else can.
	I am called <em>Broad</em>, because I have the power of swelling
	myself out to such a size that there is room for a whole
	regiment of soldiers inside me.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page159" title="159">&nbsp;</a>So saying he puffed himself out till he formed a barricade
	from one side of the road to the other.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Bravo!&#8221; cried Matthias, delighted at this proof of his
	capacities. &#8220;By the way, would you mind coming with
	me? I, too, am travelling across the world in search of
	happiness.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;If there is nothing bad in it I am quite willing,&#8221; answered
	Broad. And they continued their journey together.</p>

	<p>A little further on they met a very slender man, frightfully
	thin, and tall and straight as a portico.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Whither are you going, good man?&#8221; asked Matthias,
	filled with curiosity at his strange appearance.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am travelling about the world.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;To what profession do you belong?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;To no profession, but I know something every one else is
	ignorant of. I am called <em>Tall</em>, and with good reason. For
	without leaving the earth I can stretch out and reach up to the
	clouds. When I walk I clear a mile at each step.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Without more ado he lengthened himself out until his
	head was lost in the clouds, while he really cleared a mile at
	each step.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I like that, my fine fellow,&#8221; said Matthias. &#8220;Come, would
	you not like to travel with us?&#8221;&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; replied he. &#8220;I&#8217;ll come.&#8221;</p>

	<p>So they proceeded on their way together. While passing
	through a forest they saw a man placing trunks of trees one
	upon another.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What are you trying to do there?&#8221; asked Matthias, addressing
	him.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I have <em>Eyes of Flame</em>,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and I am building a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page160" title="160">&nbsp;</a>pile here.&#8221; So saying he fixed his flaming eyes upon the
	wood, and the whole was instantly set alight.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You are a very clever and powerful man,&#8221; said Matthias,
	&#8220;would you like to join our party?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;All right, I am willing.&#8221;</p>

	<p>So the four travelled along together. Matthias was overjoyed
	to have met with such gifted companions, and paid
	their expenses generously, without complaining of the enormous
	sum of money he had to spend on the amount of food
	Broad consumed.</p>

	<p>After some days they reached the princess&#8217;s palace.
	Matthias had told them the object of his journey, and had
	promised each a large reward if he was successful. They
	gave him their word to work with a will at the task which
	every one up till then had failed to accomplish. The prince
	bought them each a handsome suit of clothes, and when they
	were all presentable sent them to tell the king, the princess&#8217;s
	father, that he had come with his attendants to watch three
	nights in the lady&#8217;s boudoir. But he took very good care
	not to say who he was, nor whence he had come.</p>

	<p>The king received them kindly, and after hearing their
	request said: &#8220;Reflect well before engaging yourselves in this,
	for if the princess should escape you will have to die.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;We very much doubt her escaping from us,&#8221; they replied,
	&#8220;but come what will, we intend to make the attempt and to
	begin at once.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;My duty was to warn you,&#8221; replied the monarch, smiling,
	&#8220;but if you still persist in your resolution I myself will take
	you to the lady&#8217;s apartments.&#8221;</p>

	<div class="image"><a class="pagenum disguise" id="page161" title="161">&nbsp;</a>

		<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page162" title="162">&nbsp;</a>[Blank Page] -->
	</div>

	<p>Matthias was dazzled at the loveliness of the royal maiden,  <!-- Original location of pages 161 & 162 -->
	<a class="pagenum" id="page163" title="163">&nbsp;</a>while she, on her side, received the brilliant and handsome
	young man most graciously, not trying to hide how much she
	liked his good looks and gentle manner. Hardly had the
	king retired when Broad lay down across the threshold; Tall
	and the Man with Eyes of Flame placed themselves near the
	window; while Matthias talked with the princess, and watched
	her every movement attentively.</p>

	<p>Suddenly she ceased to speak, then after a few moments
	said, &#8220;I feel as if a shower of poppies were falling on my
	eyelids.&#8221;</p>

	<p>And she lay down on the couch, pretending to sleep.</p>

	<p>Matthias did not breathe a word. Seeing her asleep he
	sat down at a table near the sofa, leaned his elbows upon
	it, and rested his chin in the hollow of his hands. Gradually
	he felt drowsy and his eyes closed, as did those of his companions.</p>

	<p>Now this was the moment the princess was waiting for.
	Quickly changing herself into a dove, she flew towards the
	window. If it had not happened that one of her wings
	touched Tall&#8217;s hair he would not have awakened, and he would
	certainly never have succeeded in catching her if it had not
	been for the Man with Eyes of Flame, for he, as soon as he
	knew which direction she had taken, sent such a glance after
	her, that is, a flame of fire, that in the twinkling of an eye her
	wings were burnt, and having been thus stopped, she was
	obliged to perch on the top of a tree. From thence Tall
	reached her easily, and placed her in Matthias&#8217; hands, where
	she became a princess again. Matthias had hardly awakened
	out of his sleep.</p>

	<p>Next morning and the morning after the king was greatly
	<a class="pagenum" id="page164" title="164">&nbsp;</a>astonished to find his daughter sitting by the prince&#8217;s side, but
	he was obliged to keep silent and accept facts as they were, at
	the same time entertaining his guests royally. At the approach
	of the third night he spoke with his daughter, and begged her
	to practise all the magic of which she was capable, and to act
	in such a way as to free him from the presence of intruders of
	whom he knew neither the rank nor the fortune.</p>

	<p>As for Matthias, he used every means in his power to bring
	about a happy ending to such a hitherto successful undertaking.
	Before entering the princess&#8217;s apartments he took his comrades
	aside and said, &#8220;There is but one more stroke of luck, dear
	friends, and then we have succeeded. If we fail, do not forget
	that our four heads will roll on the scaffold.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Come along,&#8221; replied the three; &#8220;never fear, we shall be
	able to keep good watch.&#8221;</p>

	<p>When they came into the princess&#8217;s room they hastened to
	take up their positions, and Matthias sat down facing the lady.
	He would have much preferred to remain with her without
	being obliged to keep watch all the time for fear of losing her
	for ever. Resolving not to sleep this time, he said to himself,
	&#8220;Now I will keep watch upon you, but when you are my wife
	I will rest.&#8221;</p>

	<p>At midnight, when sleep was beginning to overpower her
	watchers, the princess kept silence, and, stretching herself on
	the couch, shut her beautiful eyes as if she were really asleep.</p>

	<p>Matthias, his elbows on the table, his chin in the palms of
	his hand, his eyes fixed upon her, admired her silently. But
	as sleep closes even the eyes of the eagle, so it shut those of
	the prince and his companions.</p>

	<p>The princess, who all this time had been watching them
	<a class="pagenum" id="page165" title="165">&nbsp;</a>narrowly and only waiting for this moment, got up from her
	seat, and changing herself into a little fly, flew out of the
	window. Once free, she again changed herself into a fish, and
	falling into the palace well, plunged and hid herself in the
	depths of the water.</p>

	<p>She would certainly have made her escape if, as a fly, she
	had not just touched the tip of the nose of the Man with
	Eyes of Flame. He sneezed, and opened his eyes in time to
	notice the direction in which she had disappeared. Without
	losing an instant he gave the alarm, and all four ran into the
	courtyard. The well was very deep, but that did not matter.
	Tall soon stretched himself to the required depth, and searched
	in all the corners: but he was unable to find the little fish, and
	it seemed impossible that it could ever have been there.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now then, get out of that, I will take your place,&#8221; said
	Broad.</p>

	<p>And getting in at the top by the rim, he filled up all the
	inside of the well, stopping it so completely with his huge
	body that the water sprang out: but nothing was seen of the
	little fish.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now it is my turn,&#8221; said the Man with Eyes of Flame, &#8220;I
	warrant I&#8217;ll dislodge this clever magician.&#8221;</p>

	<p>When Broad had cleared the well of his enormous person
	the water returned to its place, but it soon began to boil
	from the heat of the eyes of flame. It boiled and boiled, till
	it boiled over the rim; then, as it went on boiling and rising
	ever higher and higher, a little fish was seen to throw itself
	out on the grass half cooked. As it touched the ground it
	again took the form of the princess.</p>

	<p>Matthias went to her and kissed her tenderly.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page166" title="166">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;You have conquered, my master and husband,&#8221; she
	said, &#8220;you have succeeded in preventing my escape. Henceforth
	I am yours, both by right of conquest and of my own
	free will.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The young man&#8217;s courtesy, strength, and gentleness, as
	well as his beauty, were very pleasing to the princess; but
	her father, the king, was not so ready to approve of her
	choice, and he resolved not to let her go with them. But this
	did not trouble Matthias, who determined to carry her off,
	aided by his three comrades. They soon all left the palace.</p>

	<p>The king was furious, and ordered his guards to follow
	them and bring them back under pain of death. Meanwhile
	Matthias, the princess, and the three comrades had already
	travelled a distance of some miles. When she heard the steps
	of the pursuers she begged the Man with Eyes of Flame to
	see who they were. Having turned to look, he told her that
	a large army of men on horseback were advancing at a gallop.</p>

	<p>&#8220;They are my father&#8217;s guards,&#8221; said she, &#8220;we shall have
	some difficulty in escaping them.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then, seeing the horsemen draw nearer she took the veil
	from her face, and throwing it behind her in the direction
	of the wind, said, &#8220;I command as many trees to spring up
	as there are threads in this veil.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Instantly, in the twinkling of an eye, a high thick forest
	rose up between them. Before the soldiers had time to clear
	for themselves a pathway through this dense mass, Matthias
	and his party had been able to get far ahead, and even to
	take a little rest.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; said the princess, &#8220;and see if they are still
	coming after us.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page167" title="167">&nbsp;</a>The Man with Eyes of Flame looked back, and replied
	that the king&#8217;s guards were out of the forest and coming
	towards them with all speed.</p>

	<p>&#8220;They will not be able to reach us,&#8221; cried she. And she
	let fall a tear from her eyes, saying as she did so, &#8220;Tear,
	become a river.&#8221;</p>

	<p>At the same moment a wide river flowed between them
	and their pursuers, and before the latter had found means
	of crossing it, Matthias and his party were far on in front.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Man with Eyes of Flame,&#8221; said the princess, &#8220;look
	behind and tell me how closely we are followed.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;They are quite near to us again,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;they are
	almost upon our heels.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Darkness, cover them,&#8221; said she.</p>

	<p>At these words Tall drew himself up. He stretched and
	stretched and stretched until he reached the clouds, and
	there, with his hat he half covered the face of the sun. The
	side towards the soldiers was black as night, while Matthias
	and his party, lit up by the shining half, went a good way
	without hindrance.</p>

	<p>When they had travelled some distance, Tall uncovered
	the sun, and soon joined his companions by taking a mile
	at each step. They were already in sight of Matthias&#8217; home,
	when they noticed that the royal guards were again following
	them closely.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now it is my turn,&#8221; said Broad; &#8220;go on your way in
	safety, I will remain here. I shall be ready for them.&#8221;</p>

	<p>He quietly awaited their arrival, standing motionless, with
	his large mouth open from ear to ear. The royal army,
	who were determined not to turn back without having taken
	<a class="pagenum" id="page168" title="168">&nbsp;</a>the princess, advanced towards the town at a gallop. They
	had decided among themselves that if it resisted they would
	lay siege to it.</p>

	<p>Mistaking Broad&#8217;s open mouth for one of the city gates,
	they all dashed through and disappeared.</p>

	<p>Broad closed his mouth, and having swallowed them,
	ran to rejoin his comrades in the palace of Matthias&#8217; father.
	He felt somewhat disturbed with a whole army inside him,
	and the earth groaned and trembled beneath him as he ran.
	He could hear the shouts of the people assembled round
	Matthias, as they rejoiced at his safe return.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ah, here you are at last, brother Broad,&#8221; cried Matthias,
	directly he caught sight of him. &#8220;But what have you done
	with the army? Where have you left it?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;The army is here, quite safe,&#8221; answered he, patting his
	enormous person. &#8220;I shall be very pleased to return them
	as they are, for the morsel is not very easy to digest.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Come then, let them out of their prison,&#8221; said Matthias,
	enjoying the joke, and at the same time calling all the
	inhabitants to assist at the entertainment.</p>

	<div class="image"><a class="pagenum disguise" id="page169" title="169">&nbsp;</a>

	<p>Broad, who looked upon it as a common occurrence,
	stood in the middle of the palace square, and putting his
	hands to his sides, began to cough. Then&#8212;it was really a
	sight worth seeing&#8212;at each cough horsemen and horses fell
	out of his mouth, one over the other, plunging, hopping,
	jumping, trying who could get out of the way the quickest.
	The last one had a little difficulty in getting free, for he
	somehow got into one of Broad&#8217;s nostrils and was unable to
	move. It was only by giving a good sneeze that Broad
	could release him, the last of the royal cavaliers, and he  <!-- Original location of pages 169 & 170 -->
	<a class="pagenum" id="page171" title="171">&nbsp;</a>lost no time in following his companions at the top of
	his speed.</p>

	<p>A few days later a splendid feast was given at the wedding
	of Prince Matthias and the princess. The king, her father,
	was also present. Tall had been sent to invite him. Owing
	to his knowledge of the road and the length of his limbs,
	he accomplished the journey so quickly that he was there
	before the royal horsemen had time to get back. It was well
	for them that it was so, for, had he not pleaded that their
	lives might be saved, their heads would certainly have been
	cut off for returning empty-handed.</p>

	<p>Everything was now arranged to everybody&#8217;s satisfaction.
	The princess&#8217;s father was delighted to know that his daughter
	was married to a rich and noble prince, and Matthias
	generously rewarded his brave travelling companions, who
	remained with him to the end of their days.</p>

	</div>

	<p class="second_title">THE HISTORY OF PRINCE SLUGOBYL; OR,
	THE INVISIBLE KNIGHT</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">There</span> was once a king who had an only son, called
	Prince Slugobyl. Now this young prince loved nothing
	better than travelling; so fond of it was he that when he was
	<a class="pagenum" id="page176" title="176">&nbsp;</a>twenty years old he gave his father no rest until he allowed
	him to go on a long journey, in short, to travel all over the
	world. Thus he hoped to see many beautiful and strange
	things, to meet with marvellous adventures, to gain happiness,
	knowledge, and wisdom, and to return a better man in every
	way than when he left. Fearing his youth and want of experience
	might lead him astray, his father sent with him a valued
	and faithful servant. When all was ready, Slugobyl bade the
	king adieu and set off to visit the land of his dreams.</p>

	<p>As he was jogging along, allowing his horse to go at its
	own pace, he saw a beautiful white swan pursued by an eagle
	about to pounce down upon it. Seizing his crossbow, he took
	such good aim that the eagle fell dead at his feet. The
	rescued swan stopped in its flight, and turning round said to
	him, &#8220;Valiant Prince Slugobyl, it is not a mere swan who
	thanks you for your most timely help, but the daughter of the
	Invisible Knight, who, to escape the pursuit of the giant Kostey,
	has changed herself into a swan. My father will gladly be of
	service to you in return for this kindness to me. When in
	need of his help, you only have to say three times, &#8216;Invisible
	Knight, come to me.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

	<p>Having thus spoken the swan flew away. The prince
	looked after her for a long time, and then continued his journey.
	He travelled on and on and on, over high mountains, through
	dark forests, across barren deserts, and so to the middle of a
	vast plain where every green thing had been burnt up by the
	rays of the sun. Not a single tree, not even a bush or a plant
	of any kind was to be seen. No bird was heard to sing, no
	insect to hum, no breath of air to stir the stillness of this land
	of desolation. Having ridden for some hours, the prince
	<a class="pagenum" id="page177" title="177">&nbsp;</a>began to suffer terribly from thirst; so, sending his servant in
	one direction, he himself went in another, in search of some
	well or spring. They soon found a well full of cool fresh
	water, but unluckily without either rope or bucket to
	draw it up. After a few moments&#8217; thought the prince said
	to his servant, &#8220;Take the leathern strap used for tethering
	our horses, put it round your body, and I will then let
	you down into the well; I cannot endure this thirst any
	longer.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Your highness,&#8221; answered the servant, &#8220;I am heavier
	than you, and you are not as strong as I, so you will not be
	able to pull me out of the water. If you, therefore, will go
	down first, I shall be able to pull you up when you have
	quenched your thirst.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The prince took his advice, and fastening an end of the
	strap under his arms, was lowered into the well. When he had
	enjoyed a deep draught of the clear water and filled a bottle
	of the same for his servant, he gave the signal that he wished
	to be pulled up. But instead of obeying the servant said,
	&#8220;Listen, prince; from the day you were born up to the present
	moment you have never known anything but luxury, pleasure,
	and happiness, while I have suffered poverty and slaved all my
	life. Now we will change places, and you shall be my servant.
	If you refuse you had better make your peace with God, for I
	shall drown you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Stop, faithful servant,&#8221; cried the prince, &#8220;you will not
	be so wicked as to do that. What good will it do you?
	You will never be so happy as you have been with me,
	and you know what dreadful tortures are in store for
	murderers in the other world; their hands are plunged into
	<a class="pagenum" id="page178" title="178">&nbsp;</a>boiling pitch, their shoulders bruised with blows from red-hot
	iron clubs, and their necks sawn with wooden saws.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You may cut and saw me as much as you like in the
	other world,&#8221; said the servant, &#8220;but I shall drown you in this.&#8221;
	And he began to let the strap slide through his fingers.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the prince, &#8220;I agree to accept your
	terms. You shall be the prince and I will be your servant,
	I give you my word.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I have no faith in words that are carried away by the first
	wind that blows. Swear to confirm your promise in writing.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I swear.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The servant then let down paper and pencil, and dictated
	the following:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8220;I hereby declare that I renounce my name and rights
		in favour of the bearer of this writing, and that I acknowledge
		him to be my prince, and that I am his servant. Written
		in the well.
		<span class="signature">(Signed) <strong class="special_name">Prince Slugobyl</strong>.&#8221;</span></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>The man having taken this document, which he was
	quite unable to read, drew out the prince, took off the
	clothes in which he was dressed, and made him wear those
	he himself had just taken off. Thus disguised they travelled
	for a week, and arriving at a large city, went straight to the
	king&#8217;s palace. There the false prince dismissed his pretended
	servant to the stables, and presenting himself before the king,
	addressed him thus in a very haughty manner:</p>

	<p>&#8220;King, I am come to demand the hand of your wise and
	beautiful daughter, whose fame has reached my father&#8217;s court.
	In exchange I offer our alliance, and in case of refusal, war.&#8221;</p>

		<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page180" title="180">&nbsp;</a>[Blank Page] -->
	</div>

	<p>&#8220;Prayers and threats are equally out of place,&#8221; answered the  <!-- Original location of pages 179 & 180 -->
	<a class="pagenum" id="page181" title="181">&nbsp;</a>king; &#8220;nevertheless, prince, as proof of the esteem in which I
	hold the king, your father, I grant your request: but only on
	one condition, that you deliver us from a large army that now
	besets our town. Do this, and my daughter shall be yours.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said the impostor, &#8220;I can soon get rid of
	them, however near they may be. I undertake by to-morrow
	morning to have freed the land entirely of them.&#8221;</p>

	<p>In the evening he went to the stables, and calling his
	pretended servant, saluted him respectfully and said, &#8220;Listen,
	my dear friend, I want you to go immediately outside the
	town and destroy the besieging army that surrounds it. But
	do it in such a way that every one will believe that I have
	done it. In exchange for this favour I promise to return
	the writing in which you renounced your title of prince and
	engaged to serve me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The prince put on his armour, mounted his horse, and
	rode outside the city gates. There he stopped and called
	three times to the Invisible Knight.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Behold me, prince, at your service,&#8221; said a voice close
	to him. &#8220;I will do anything you wish, for you saved my
	only daughter from the hands of the giant Kostey; I shall
	always be grateful.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Slugobyl showed him the army he had to destroy before
	morning, and the Invisible Knight whistled and sang:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Magu, Horse with Golden Mane,</p>
		<p>I want your help yet once again,</p>
		<p>Walk not the earth but fly through space</p>
		<p>As lightnings flash or thunders race.</p>
		<p>Swift as the arrow from the bow,</p>
		<p>Come quick, yet so that none can know.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page182" title="182">&nbsp;</a>At that instant a magnificent grey horse appeared out of
	a whirlwind of smoke, and from his head there hung a
	golden mane. Swift as the wind was he, flames of fire
	blazed forth from his nostrils, lightnings flashed from his
	eyes, and volumes of smoke came from his ears. The
	Invisible Knight leapt upon his back, saying to the prince,
	&#8220;Take my sword and destroy the left wing of the army,
	while I attack the right wing and the centre.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The two heroes rushed forward and attacked the invaders
	with such fury that on all sides men fell like chopped wood
	or dried grass. A frightful massacre followed, but it was
	in vain that the enemy fled, for the two knights seemed to
	be everywhere. Within a short time only the dead and dying
	remained on the battle-field, and the two conquerors quietly
	returned to the town. On reaching the palace steps, the
	Invisible Knight melted into the morning mist, and the
	serving-man prince returned to the stables.</p>

	<p>That same night it happened that the king&#8217;s daughter,
	not being able to sleep, had remained on her balcony and
	seen and heard all that had taken place. She had overheard
	the conversation between the impostor and the real prince,
	had seen the latter call to his assistance the Invisible Knight,
	and then doff his royal armour in favour of the false prince;
	she had seen and understood everything, but she determined
	to keep silence for a little longer.</p>

	<p>But when on the next day the king, her father, celebrated
	the victory of the false prince with great rejoicings, loaded
	him with honours and presents, and calling his daughter expressed
	a wish that she should marry him&#8212;the princess could
	be silent no longer. She walked up to the real prince, who
	<a class="pagenum" id="page183" title="183">&nbsp;</a>was waiting at table with the other servants, took his arm,
	and leading him to the king, said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Father, and all good people, this is the man who has
	saved our country from the enemy, and whom God has
	destined to be my husband. He to whom you pay these
	honours is but a vile impostor, who has robbed his master
	of name and rights. Last night I witnessed such deeds as
	eye has never seen nor ear heard, but which shall be told
	afterwards. Bid this traitor show the writing which proves
	the truth of what I say.&#8221;</p>

	<p>When the false prince had delivered up the paper signed
	by the serving-man prince, it was found to contain the
	following words:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8220;The bearer of this document, the false and wicked servant
		of the serving-man prince, shall receive the punishment
		his sin deserves.
		<span class="signature">(Signed)  <strong class="special_name">Prince Slugobyl</strong>.&#8221;</span></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>&#8220;What? Is that the real meaning of that writing?&#8221;
	asked the traitor, who could not read.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Most assuredly,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

	<p>Then he threw himself at the king&#8217;s feet and begged for
	mercy. But he received his punishment, for he was tied to
	the tails of four wild horses and torn to pieces.</p>

	<p>Prince Slugobyl married the princess. It was a magnificent
	wedding. I myself was there, and drank of the mead
	and wine; but they only touched my beard, they did not
	enter my mouth.</p>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">In</span> ancient days there lived a king
		and queen; the former was old but
		the latter young. Although they loved
		one another dearly they were very unhappy,
		for God had not given them
		any children. They fretted and grieved
		about this so deeply that the queen
		became ill with melancholy. The
		doctors advised her to travel. The
		king was obliged to remain at home,
		so she went without him, accompanied
		by twelve maids of honour, all beautiful
		and fresh as flowers in May. When
		they had travelled for some days, they
		reached a vast uninhabited plain which
		stretched so far away it seemed to
		touch the sky. After driving hither
		and thither for some time the driver was
		quite bewildered, and stopped before a
		<a class="pagenum" id="page188" title="188">&nbsp;</a>large stone column. At its foot stood a warrior on horseback,
		clad in steel armour.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Brave knight, can you direct me to the high-road?&#8221;
		said the driver; &#8220;we are lost, and know not which way
		to go.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;I will show you the way,&#8221; said the warrior, &#8220;but only on
		one condition, that each of you gives me a kiss.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The queen looked at the warrior in wrath, and ordered
		the coachman to drive on. The carriage continued moving
		nearly all day, but as if bewitched, for it always returned
		to the stone column. This time the queen addressed the
		warrior.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Knight,&#8221; said she, &#8220;show us the road, and I will reward
		you richly.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;I am the Master Spirit of the Steppes,&#8221; answered he.
		&#8220;I demand payment for showing the way, and my payment
		is always in kisses.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Very well, my twelve maids of honour shall pay you.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Thirteen kisses are due to me; the first must be given
		by the lady who addresses me.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The queen was very angry, and again the attempt was
		made to find their way. But the carriage, though during the
		whole time it moved in an opposite direction, still returned
		to the stone column. It was now dark, and they were obliged
		to think of finding shelter for the night, so the queen was
		obliged to give the warrior his strange payment. Getting out
		of her carriage she walked up to the knight, and looking
		modestly down allowed him to kiss her; her twelve maids
		of honour who followed did the same. A moment later
		stone column and horseman had vanished, and they found
		<a class="pagenum" id="page189" title="189">&nbsp;</a>themselves on the high-road, while a perfumed cloud seemed
		to float over the steppes. The queen stepped into her carriage
		with her ladies, and so the journey was continued.</p>

		<p>But from that day the beautiful queen and her maids
		became thoughtful and sad; and, losing all pleasure in travel,
		went back to the capital. Yet the return home did not make
		the queen happy, for always before her eyes she saw the
		Horseman of the Steppes. This displeased the king, who
		became gloomy and ill-tempered.</p>

		<p>One day while the king was on his throne in the council
		chamber he suddenly heard the sweetest warblings, like unto
		those produced by a bird of paradise; these were answered
		by the songs of many nightingales. Wondering, he sent to
		find out what it was. The messenger returned saying that
		the queen and her twelve maids of honour had each been
		presented with a girl baby, and that the sweet warblings were
		but the crying of the children. The king was greatly astonished,
		and while he was engaged in deep thought about the
		matter the palace was suddenly lit up by lights of dazzling
		brightness. On inquiring into the cause he learnt that the
		little princess had opened her eyes, and that they shone with
		matchless brilliancy.</p>

		<p>At first the king could not speak, so amazed was he. He
		laughed and he cried, he sorrowed and he rejoiced, and in
		the midst of it all a deputation of ministers and senators was
		announced. When these were shown into his presence they
		fell on their knees, and striking the ground with their foreheads,
		said, &#8220;Sire, save your people and your royal person.
		The queen and her twelve maids of honour have been presented
		by the Spirit of the Steppes with thirteen girl babies. We
		<a class="pagenum" id="page190" title="190">&nbsp;</a>beseech you to have these children killed, or we shall all be
		destroyed.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The king, roused to anger, gave orders that all the babies
		should be thrown into the sea. The courtiers were already on
		their way to obey this cruel command when the queen entered,
		weeping, and pale as death. She threw herself at the king&#8217;s
		feet and begged him to spare the lives of these helpless and
		innocent children, and instead to let them be placed on a
		desert island and there left in the hands of God.</p>

		<p>The king granted her wish. The baby princess was placed
		in a golden cradle, her little companions in copper cradles,
		and the thirteen were taken to a desert island and left quite
		alone. Every one at court thought that they had perished,
		and said one to another, &#8220;They will die from cold and hunger;
		they will be devoured by wild beasts, or birds of prey; they
		are sure to die; perchance they will be buried under dead
		leaves or covered with snow.&#8221; But happily nothing of the
		kind happened, for God takes care of little children.</p>

	<p>The small princess grew bigger day by day. Every
	morning she was awakened by the rising sun, and bathed by
	the dew. Soft breezes refreshed her, and twisted into plaits
	her luxuriant hair. The trees sang her to sleep with their
	rustling lullabies, the stars watched over her at night. The
	swans clothed her in their soft raiment, and the bees fed her
	with their honey. The beauty of the little maiden increased
	with her growth. Her brow was calm and pure as the moon,
	her lips red as a rosebud, and so eloquent that her voice
	sounded like a shower of pearls. But wonderful beyond
	compare was the expressive beauty of her eyes, for if she
	looked at you kindly you seemed to float in a sea of joy, if  <!-- Original location of pages 191 & 192 -->
	<a class="pagenum" id="page193" title="193">&nbsp;</a>angrily it made you numb with fear, and you were instantly
	changed into a block of ice. She was waited upon by her
	twelve companions, who were almost as charming as their
	mistress, to whom they were devotedly attached. Rumours
	of the loveliness of Princess Sudolisu spread far and wide.
	People came to see her from all parts of the world, so that it
	was soon no longer a desert island, but a thickly populated
	and magnificent city.</p>

	<p>Many a prince came from afar and entered the lists as
	suitor for the hand of Sudolisu, but none succeeded in winning
	her love. Those who bore with good temper and resignation
	the disappointment of being refused returned home safe and
	sound, but woe to the unlucky wretch who rebelled against
	her will and attempted to use an armed force; his soldiers
	perished miserably, while he, frozen to the heart by her angry
	glance, was turned into a block of ice.</p>

	<p>Now it happened that the famous ogre, Kostey, who
	lived underground, was a great admirer of beauty. And he
	took it into his head to see what the creatures above ground
	were doing. By the help of his telescope he was able to
	observe all the kings and queens, princes and princesses,
	gentlemen and ladies, living on the earth. As he was looking
	his eye fell upon a beautiful island, where, bright as many
	stars, stood twelve maidens; while in their midst, upon a couch
	of swan&#8217;s-down, slept a young princess lovely as the dawn
	of day. Sudolisu was dreaming of a young knight who rode
	a spirited horse; on his breast was a golden cuirass, and in
	his hand an invisible club. And in her dream she admired
	this knight, and loved him more than life itself. The wicked
	Kostey longed to have her for his own, and determined to
	<a class="pagenum" id="page194" title="194">&nbsp;</a>carry her off. He reached the earth by striking it from underground
	three times with his forehead. The princess called
	her army together, and putting herself at its head, led her
	soldiers against him. But he merely breathed upon the
	soldiers and they fell down in an overpowering sleep. Then
	he stretched out his bony hands to take the princess, but she,
	throwing a glance full of anger and disdain at him, changed
	him into a block of ice. Then she shut herself up in her
	palace. Kostey did not remain frozen long; when the princess
	had departed he came to life again, and started off in pursuit
	of her. On reaching the town where she dwelt, he put all the
	inhabitants into a charmed sleep, and laid the same spell
	upon the twelve maids of honour. Fearing the power of her
	eyes, he dared not attack Sudolisu herself; so he surrounded
	her palace with an iron wall, and left it in charge of a monster
	dragon with twelve heads. Then he waited, in hope that the
	princess would give in.</p>

	<p>Days passed, weeks grew into months, and still Princess
	Sudolisu&#8217;s kingdom looked like one large bedchamber. The
	people snored in the streets, the brave army lying in the fields
	slept soundly, hidden in the long grass under the shadow
	of nettle, wormwood, and thistle, rust and dust marring the
	brightness of their armour. Inside the palace everything was
	the same. The twelve maids of honour lay motionless. The
	princess alone kept watch, silent amid this reign of sleep. She
	walked up and down her narrow prison, sighing and weeping
	bitter tears, but no other sound broke the silence; only Kostey,
	avoiding her glance, still called through the doors and begged
	her to refuse him no longer. Then he promised she should be
	Queen of the Nether World, but she answered him not.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page195" title="195">&nbsp;</a>Lonely and miserable, she thought of the prince of her
	dreams. She saw him in his golden armour, mounted on his
	spirited steed, looking at her with eyes full of love. So she
	imagined him day and night.</p>

	<p>Looking out of window one day, and seeing a cloud floating
	on the horizon, she cried:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Floating Cloudlet soft and white,</p>
		<p class="i2">Pilgrim of the sky,</p>
		<p>I pray you for one moment, light</p>
		<p class="i2">On me your pitying eye.</p>
		<p>Where my love is can you tell?</p>
		<p>Thinks he of me ill or well?&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>&#8220;I know not,&#8221; answered the cloud, &#8220;ask the wind.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then she saw a tiny breeze playing among the field flowers,
	and called out:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Gentle Breezelet, soul of air,</p>
		<p class="i2">Look not lightly on my pain;</p>
		<p>Kindly lift me from despair,</p>
		<p class="i2">Help me freedom to regain.</p>
		<p>Where my love is can you tell?</p>
		<p>Thinks he of me ill or well?&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>&#8220;Ask that little star yonder,&#8221; answered the breeze, &#8220;she
	knows more than I.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Sudolisu raised her beautiful eyes to the twinkling stars
	and said:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Shining Star, God&#8217;s light on high,</p>
		<p class="i2">Look down and prithee see;</p>
		<p>Behold me weep and hear me sigh,</p>
		<p class="i2">Then help and pity me.</p>
		<p>Where my love is canst thou tell?</p>
		<p>Thinks he of me ill or well?&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page196" title="196">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;You will learn more from the moon,&#8221; answered the star;
	&#8220;she lives nearer the earth than I, and sees everything that
	goes on there.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The moon was just rising from her silver bed when
	Sudolisu called to her:</p>


	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Pearl of the Sky, thou radiant Moon,</p>
		<p class="i2">Thy watch o&#8217;er the stars pray leave,</p>
		<p>Throw thy soft glance o&#8217;er the earth ere I swoon,</p>
		<p class="i2">O&#8217;ercome by my sorrows I weep and I grieve.</p>
		<p>I pine for my friend, oh ease thou my heart,</p>
		<p>And say, am I loved? In his thoughts have I part?&#8221;</p>
	</div>


	<p>&#8220;Princess,&#8221; replied the moon, &#8220;I know nothing of your
	friend. But wait a few hours, the sun will have then risen;
	he knows everything, and will surely be able to tell you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>So the princess kept her eyes fixed upon that part of the
	sky where the sun first appears, chasing away the darkness
	like a flock of birds. When he came forth in all his glory
	she said:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Soul of the World, thou deep fountain of life,</p>
		<p class="i2">Eye of all-powerful God,</p>
		<p>Visit my prison, dark scene of sad strife,</p>
		<p class="i2">Raise up my soul from the sod,</p>
		<p>With hope that my friend whom I pine for and love</p>
		<p>May come to my rescue. Say, where does he rove?&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>&#8220;Sweet Sudolisu,&#8221; answered the sun, &#8220;dry the tears that
	like pearls roll down your sad and lovely face. Let your
	troubled heart be at peace, for your friend the prince is now
	on his way to rescue you. He has recovered the magic ring
	from the Nether World, and many armies from those countries
	<a class="pagenum" id="page197" title="197">&nbsp;</a>have assembled to follow him. He is now moving towards
	Kostey&#8217;s palace, and intends to punish him. But all this will
	be of no avail, and Kostey will gain the victory, if the prince
	does not make use of other means which I am now on my
	way to provide him with. Farewell; be brave, he whom you
	love will come to your aid and save you from Kostey and his
	sorceries; happiness is in store for you both.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The sun then rose upon a distant land where Prince Junak,
	mounted on a powerful steed and clad in golden armour,
	assembled his forces to fight against the giant Kostey. Thrice
	he had dreamt of the beautiful princess shut up in the Sleeping
	Palace, for the fame of her loveliness had reached him, and he
	loved without having seen.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Leave your army where it is,&#8221; said the sun, &#8220;it will not
	be of the slightest use in fighting against Kostey, he is proof
	against all weapons. The only way to rescue the princess is
	to kill him, and there is but one who can tell you how to do
	it, and that is the witch, old Yaga. I will show you how to
	find the horse that will carry you straight to her. First take
	the road to the east, and walk on till you come to a wide
	plain: there, right in the middle of the plain, are three
	oaks, and in the centre of these, lying close to the ground,
	is an iron door with a copper handle. Behind the door is
	the horse, also an invisible club; both are necessary for
	the work you have to do. You will learn the rest afterwards.
	Farewell.&#8221;</p>

	<p>This advice astonished the prince greatly; he hardly knew
	what to do. After deep reflection he crossed himself, took the
	magic ring from his finger and cast it into the sea. Instantly
	the army vanished like mist before the wind, and when not a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page198" title="198">&nbsp;</a>trace of it was left he took the road to the east. After walking
	straight on for eight days he reached a large green plain, in the
	middle of which grew the three oaks, and in the centre of
	these, close to the ground, was the iron door with the copper
	handle. Opening the door, he found a winding staircase
	which led to a second door bound with iron, and shut by
	means of a huge padlock sixty pounds in weight. At this
	moment he heard the neighing of a horse, the sound being
	followed by the opening of eleven other iron doors. There he
	saw the war-horse which centuries ago had been bewitched
	by a magician. The prince whistled; the horse immediately
	bounded towards him, at the same time breaking the twelve
	iron chains that fastened him to the manger. He was a
	beautiful creature, strong, light, handsome, full of fire and
	grace; his eyes flashed lightnings, from his nostrils came
	flames of fire, his mane was like a cloud of gold, he was
	certainly a marvel of a horse.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Prince Junak,&#8221; said the steed, &#8220;I have waited centuries
	for such a knight as you; here I am, ready to carry you and
	serve you faithfully. Mount upon my back, and take hold of
	the invisible club that hangs at the pommel of the saddle.
	You yourself will not need to use it; give it your orders, it will
	carry them out and do the fighting itself. Now we will start;
	may God look after us! Tell me where you wish to go, and
	you shall be there directly.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The prince quickly told the horse his history, mounted,
	seized the club, and set off. The creature capered, galloped,
	flew, and swam in the air higher than the highest forests but
	lower than the clouds; he crossed mountains, rivers, and precipices;
	he barely touched the blades of grass in passing over
	<a class="pagenum" id="page199" title="199">&nbsp;</a>them, and went so lightly along the roads that he did not raise
	one grain of dust.</p>

	<p>Towards sunset Junak found himself close to an immense
	forest, in the centre of which stood Yaga&#8217;s house. All around
	were oaks and pines hundreds of years old, untouched by the
	axe of man. These enormous trees, lit up by the rays of the
	setting sun, seemed to look with astonishment at their strange
	guest. The silence was absolute; not a bird sang in the
	branches, not an insect hummed in the air, not a worm
	crawled upon the ground. The only sound was that made
	by the horse as he broke through the underwood. Then they
	came in sight of a small house supported by a cock&#8217;s foot,
	round which it turned as on a movable pivot. Prince Junak
	cried:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Turn round, little house, turn round,</p>
		<p class="i2">I want to come inside;</p>
		<p>Let thy back to the forest be found,</p>
		<p class="i2">Thy door to me open wide.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>The little house turned round, and the prince entering saw
	old Yaga, who immediately cried out, &#8220;What, Prince Junak!
	How have you come here, where no one ever enters?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You are a silly old witch, to worry me with questions
	instead of making me welcome,&#8221; said the prince.</p>

	<p>At these words old Yaga jumped up and hastened to
	attend to his needs. She prepared food and drink, made him
	a soft bed where he could sleep comfortably, and then leaving
	the house passed the night out of doors. On her return in
	the morning the prince related all his adventures and confided
	his plans.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Prince Junak,&#8221; said she, &#8220;you have undertaken a very
	<a class="pagenum" id="page200" title="200">&nbsp;</a>difficult task, but your courage will enable you to accomplish
	it successfully. I will tell you how to kill Kostey, for without
	that you can do nothing. Now, in the very midst of the ocean
	lies the Island of Eternal Life. Upon this island is an oak
	tree, and at the foot of it, hidden in the earth, a coffer bound
	with iron. A hare is shut up in this coffer, and under her sits
	a grey duck whose body contains an egg. Within this egg
	is Kostey&#8217;s life&#8212;if it be broken he dies. Good-bye, Prince
	Junak, start without loss of time. Your horse will carry you
	to the island.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Junak mounted his horse, spoke a few words to him, and
	the brave creature fled through space with the swiftness of an
	arrow. Leaving the forest and its enormous trees behind, they
	soon reached the shores of the ocean. Fishermen&#8217;s nets lay
	on the beach, and in one of them was a large sea fish who,
	struggling to free itself, spoke to the prince in a human
	voice.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Prince Junak,&#8221; he said sadly, &#8220;free me from my prison;
	I assure you you will lose nothing by doing me this service.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Junak did what was required of him, and threw the fish
	back into the water. It plunged and disappeared, but he
	paid little attention to it, so occupied was he with his own
	thoughts. In the far distance could be seen the rocks of the
	Island of Eternal Life, but there seemed no way of reaching
	it. Leaning on his club he thought and thought, and ever as
	he thought he grew sadder and sadder.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What is the matter, Prince Junak? Has anything vexed
	you?&#8221; asked his horse.</p>

	<p>&#8220;How can I help grieving when, while in sight of the
	island, I can go no further? How can we cross the sea?&#8221;</p>

	<div class="image"><a class="pagenum disguise" id="page201" title="201">&nbsp;</a>

		<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page202" title="202">&nbsp;</a>[Blank Page] -->
	</div>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page203" title="203">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Get on my back, prince, I will be your bridge; only
	take care to hold on tight.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The prince held firmly to its mane, and the horse leapt into
	the sea. At first they were plunged right beneath the waves,
	but rising again to the surface swam easily across. The
	sun was about to set when the prince dismounted on the
	Island of Eternal Life. He first took off his horse&#8217;s harness,
	and leaving him to browse on the green grass, hurried to the
	top of a distant hill, whence he could see a large oak.
	Without losing a moment he hastened towards it, seized
	the tree with both hands, pulled at it with all his might,
	and after the most violent efforts tore it up by the roots
	from the place it had filled for centuries. The tree groaned
	and fell, and the hole in which it had been planted appeared
	like an immense case. Right at the bottom of this case
	was a coffer bound with iron. The prince took it up, broke
	the lock by striking it with a stone, opened it and seized
	the hare that was trying to make its escape. The grey duck
	that had lain underneath flew off towards the sea: the prince
	fired, struck the bird, the latter dropped its egg into the
	sea, and both were swallowed by the waves. Junak gave
	a cry of despair and rushed to the beach. At first he
	could see nothing. After a few minutes there was a slight
	movement of the waves, while upon the surface swam the
	fish whose life he had saved. It came towards him, right
	on to the sand, and dropping the lost egg at his feet, said:
	&#8220;You see, prince, I have not forgotten your kindness, and
	now I have found it in my power to be of service to you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Having thus spoken it disappeared in the water. The
	prince took the egg, mounted his horse, and crossing the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page204" title="204">&nbsp;</a>sea with his heart full of hope, journeyed towards the island
	where Princess Sudolisu kept watch over her sleeping subjects
	in the Enchanted Palace. The latter was surrounded by a
	wall, and guarded by the Dragon with Twelve Heads. Now
	these heads went to sleep in turn, six at a time, so it was
	impossible to take him unawares or to kill him, for that could
	be done only by his own blows.</p>

	<p>On reaching the palace gates Junak sent his invisible
	club forward to clear the way, whereupon it threw itself upon
	the dragon, and began to beat all the heads unmercifully.
	The blows came so thick and fast that the body was soon
	crushed to pieces. Still the dragon lived and beat the air
	with its claws. Then it opened its twelve jaws from which
	darted pointed tongues, but it could not lay hold of the
	invisible club. At last, tormented on all sides and filled
	with rage, it buried its sharp claws in its own body and died.
	The prince then entered the palace gates, and having put
	his faithful horse in the stables and armed himself with his
	invisible club, made his way for the tower in which the
	princess was shut up. On seeing him she cried out, &#8220;Prince,
	I rejoiced to see your victory over the dragon. There is
	yet a more terrible foe to conquer, and he is my jailor,
	the cruel Kostey. Beware of him, for if he should kill
	you, I shall throw myself out of window into the precipice
	beneath.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Be comforted, my princess: for in this egg I hold the
	life or death of Kostey.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then turning to the invisible club, he said, &#8220;Press forward,
	my invisible club; strike your best, and rid the earth
	of this wicked giant.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page205" title="205">&nbsp;</a>The club began by breaking down the iron doors, and
	thus reached Kostey. The giant was soon so crippled with
	blows that his teeth were smashed, lightnings flashed from his
	eyes, and he rolled round and round like a pin-cushion.
	Had he been a man he must have died under such treatment.
	But he was no man, this master of sorcery. So he
	managed to get on his feet and look for his tormentor.
	The blows from the club rained hard upon him all the
	time, and with such effect that his groans could be heard
	all over the island. On approaching the window he saw
	Prince Junak.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ah, wretch!&#8221; cried the ogre, &#8220;it is you, is it, who
	torments me in this way!&#8221; and he prepared to blow upon
	him with his poisonous breath. But the prince instantly
	crushed the egg between his hands, the shell broke, the
	white and yellow mingled and flowed to the ground, and
	Kostey died.</p>

	<p>As the sorcerer breathed his last, the enchantments
	vanished and the sleeping islanders awoke. The army, once
	more afoot, advanced with beating drums to the palace, and
	everything fell into its accustomed place. As soon as Princess
	Sudolisu was freed from her prison she held out her white
	hand to her deliverer, and thanking him in the most touching
	words, led him to the throne and placed him at her side.
	The twelve maids of honour having chosen young and brave
	warriors, ranged themselves with their lovers round the
	queen. Then the doors were thrown open, and the priests in
	their robes entered, bearing a golden tray of wedding rings.
	Thereupon the marriage ceremony was gone through, and the
	lovers united in God&#8217;s name.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page206" title="206">&nbsp;</a>After the wedding there were feasting and music and
	dancing, as is usual on such occasions, and they all enjoyed
	themselves. It makes one glad to think how happy they
	were, and what a glorious time they had after their misfortunes.</p>

	<p class="second_title">THE PRINCE WITH THE GOLDEN HAND</p>


	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">There</span> once lived a king and queen
	who had an only daughter. And the
	beauty of this princess surpassed everything
	seen or heard of. Her forehead was
	brilliant as the moon, her lips like the
	rose, her complexion had the delicacy of
	the lily, and her breath the sweetness of
	jessamine. Her hair was golden, and in
	her voice and glance there was something
	<a class="pagenum" id="page210" title="210">&nbsp;</a>so enchanting that none could help listening to her or looking
	at her.</p>

	<p>The princess lived for seventeen years in her own rooms,
	rejoicing the heart of her parents, teachers, and servants. No
	one else ever saw her, for the sons of the king and all other
	princes were forbidden to enter her rooms. She never went
	anywhere, never looked upon the outside world, and never
	breathed the outer air, but she was perfectly happy.</p>

	<p>When she was eighteen it happened, either by chance or
	by the will of fate, that she heard the cry of the cuckoo. This
	sound made her strangely uneasy; her golden head drooped,
	and covering her eyes with her hands, she fell into thought so
	deep as not to hear her mother enter. The queen looked at
	her anxiously, and after comforting her went to tell the king
	about it.</p>

	<p>For many years past the sons of kings and neighbouring
	princes had, either personally or by their ambassadors, presented
	themselves at court to ask the king for the hand of
	his daughter in marriage. But he had always bidden them
	wait until another time. Now, after a long consultation with
	the queen, he sent messengers to foreign courts and elsewhere
	to proclaim that the princess, in accordance with the wishes
	of her parents, was about to choose a husband, and that the
	man of her choice would also have the right of succession to
	the throne.</p>

	<p>When the princess heard of this decision her joy was very
	great, and for days she would dream about it. Then she
	looked out into the garden through the golden lattice of her
	window, and longed with an irresistible longing to walk in the
	open air upon the smooth lawn. With great difficulty she at
	<a class="pagenum" id="page211" title="211">&nbsp;</a>last persuaded her governesses to allow her to do so, they
	agreeing on condition that she should keep with them. So
	the crystal doors were thrown open, the oaken gates that shut
	in the orchard turned on their hinges, and the princess found
	herself on the green grass. She ran about, picking the sweet-scented
	flowers and chasing the many-coloured butterflies.
	But she could not have been a very prudent maiden, for
	she wandered away from her governesses, with her face
	uncovered.</p>

	<p>Just at that moment a raging hurricane, such as had never
	been seen or heard before, passed by and fell upon the garden.
	It roared and whistled round and round, then seizing the
	princess carried her far away. The terrified governesses
	wrung their hands, and were for a time speechless with grief.
	At last they rushed into the palace, and throwing themselves
	on their knees before the king and queen, told them with
	sobs and tears what had happened. They were overwhelmed
	with sorrow and knew not what to do.</p>

	<p>By this time quite a crowd of princes had arrived at the
	palace, and seeing the king in such bitter grief, inquired the
	reason of it.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Sorrow has touched my white hairs,&#8221; said the king.
	&#8220;The hurricane has carried off my dearly beloved child, the
	sweet Princess with the Golden Hair, and I know not where
	it has taken her. Whoever finds this out, and brings her
	back to me, shall have her for his wife, and with her half my
	kingdom for a wedding present, and the remainder of my
	wealth and titles after my death.&#8221;</p>

	<p>After hearing these words, princes and knights mounted
	their horses and set off to search throughout the world for
	<a class="pagenum" id="page212" title="212">&nbsp;</a>the beautiful Princess with the Golden Hair, who had been
	carried away by Vikher.</p>

	<p>Now among the seekers were two brothers, sons of a king,
	and they travelled together through many countries asking
	for news of the princess, but no one knew anything about
	her. But they continued their search, and at the end of two
	years arrived in a country that lies in the centre of the earth,
	and has summer and winter at the same time.</p>

	<p>The princes determined to find out whether this was the
	place where the hurricane had hidden the Princess with the
	Golden Hair. So they began to ascend one of the mountains
	on foot, leaving their horses behind them to feed on the grass.
	On reaching the top, they came in sight of a silver palace
	supported on a cock&#8217;s foot, while at one of the windows the
	sun&#8217;s rays shone upon a head of golden hair; surely it could
	only belong to the princess. Suddenly the north wind blew
	so violently, and the cold became so intense, that the leaves
	of the trees withered and the breath froze. The two princes
	tried to keep their footing, and battled manfully against the
	storm, but they were overcome by its fierceness and fell
	together, frozen to death.</p>

	<p>Their broken-hearted parents waited for them in vain.
	Masses were said, charities distributed, and prayers sent up
	to God to pity them in their sorrow.</p>

	<p>One day when the queen, the mother of the princes, was
	giving a poor old man some money she said to him, &#8220;My good
	old friend, pray God to guard our sons and soon bring them
	back in good health.&#8221;</p>

</div>

	<div class="image"><a class="pagenum disguise" id="page213" title="213">&nbsp;</a>
		<a href="images/illo-36.png"><img src="images/illo-36-th.png" width="313" height="497" alt="A young woman gives a stooped old man some coins." /></a>
		<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page214" title="214">&nbsp;</a>[Blank Page] -->
	</div>

	<p>&#8220;Ah, noble lady,&#8221; answered he, &#8220;that prayer would be
	useless. Everlasting rest is all one may ask for the dead,  <!-- Original location of pages 213 & 214 -->
	<a class="pagenum" id="page215" title="215">&nbsp;</a>but in return for the love you have shown and the money
	you have given the poor and needy, I am charged with this
	message&#8212;that God has taken pity on your sorrow, and that
	ere long you will be the mother of a son, the like of whom
	has never yet been seen.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The old man, having spoken thus, vanished.</p>

	<p>The queen, whose tears were falling, felt a strange joy enter
	her heart and a feeling of happiness steal over her, as she went
	to the king and repeated the old man&#8217;s words. And so it
	came to pass, for a week or two later God sent her a son, and
	he was in no way like an ordinary child. His eyes resembled
	those of a falcon, and his eyebrows the sable&#8217;s fur. His right
	hand was of pure gold, and his manner and appearance were
	so full of an indescribable majesty, that he was looked upon
	by every one with a feeling of awe.</p>

	<p>His growth, too, was not like that of other children.
	When but three days old, he stepped out of his swaddling-clothes
	and left his cradle. And he was so strong that when
	his parents entered the room he ran towards them, crying out,
	&#8220;Good morning, dear parents, why are you so sad? Are you
	not happy at the sight of me?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;We are indeed happy, dear child, and we thank God for
	having sent us you in our great grief. But we cannot forget
	your two brothers; they were so handsome and brave, and
	worthy of a great destiny. And our sadness is increased when
	we remember that, instead of resting in their own country in
	the tomb of their forefathers, they sleep in an unknown land,
	perhaps without burial. Alas! it is three years since we had
	news of them.&#8221;</p>

	<p>At these words the child&#8217;s tears fell, and he embraced his
	<a class="pagenum" id="page216" title="216">&nbsp;</a>parents and said, &#8220;Weep no more, dear parents, you shall
	soon be comforted: for before next spring I shall be a strong
	young man, and will look for my brothers all over the world.
	And I will bring them back to you, if not alive, yet dead:
	ay, though I have to seek them in the very centre of the
	earth.&#8221;</p>

	<p>At these words and at that which followed the king and
	queen were amazed. For the strange child, guided as it were
	by an invisible hand, rushed into the garden, and in spite of
	the cold, for it was not yet daylight, bathed in the early dew.
	When the sun had risen he threw himself down near a little
	wood on the fine sand, rubbed and rolled himself in it, and
	returned home, no longer a child but a youth.</p>

	<p>It was pleasant to the king to see his son thrive in this
	way, and indeed the young prince was the handsomest in the
	whole land. He grew from hour to hour. At the end of a
	month he could wield a sword, in two months he rode on
	horseback, in three months he had grown a beautiful moustache
	of pure gold. Then he put on a helmet, and presenting
	himself before the king and queen, said: &#8220;My much honoured
	parents, your son asks your blessing. I am no longer a child,
	and now go to seek my brothers. In order to find them I
	will, if necessary, go to the furthest ends of the world.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ah, do not venture. Stay rather with us, dear son, you
	are still too young to be exposed to the risks of such an
	undertaking.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Adventures have no terrors for me,&#8221; replied the young
	hero, &#8220;I trust in God. Why should I for a moment hesitate
	to face these dangers? Whatever Destiny has in store for us
	will happen, whatever we may do to try to prevent it.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page217" title="217">&nbsp;</a>So they agreed to let him go. Weeping they bade him
	farewell, blessing him and the road he was to travel.</p>

	<p>A pleasant tale is soon told, but events do not pass so
	quickly.</p>

	<p>The young prince crossed deep rivers and climbed high
	mountains, till he came to a dark forest. In the distance he
	saw a cottage supported on a cock&#8217;s foot, and standing in the
	midst of a field full of poppies. As he made his ways towards
	it he was suddenly seized by an overpowering longing to sleep,
	but he urged on his horse, and breaking off the poppy heads
	as he galloped through the field, came up close to the house.
	Then he called out:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Little cot, turn around, on thy foot turn thou free;</p>
		<p>To the forest set thy back, let thy door be wide to me.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>The cottage turned round with a great creaking noise, the
	door facing the prince. He entered, and found an old woman
	with thin white hair and a face covered with wrinkles, truly
	frightful to look upon. She was sitting at a table, her head
	resting on her hands, her eyes fixed on the ceiling, lost in
	deep thought. Near her were two beautiful girls, their
	complexions like lilies and roses, and in every way sweet
	to the eye.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ah, how do you do, Prince with Moustache of Gold,
	Hero with the Golden Fist?&#8221; said old Yaga; &#8220;what has
	brought you here?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Having told her the object of his journey, she replied,
	&#8220;Your elder brothers perished on the mountain that touches
	the clouds, while in search of the Princess with the Golden
	Hair, who was carried off by Vikher, the hurricane.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page218" title="218">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;And how is this thief Vikher to be got at?&#8221; asked the
	prince.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ah, my dear child, he would swallow you like a fly.
	It is now a hundred years since I went outside this cottage,
	for fear Vikher should seize me and carry me off to his palace
	near the sky.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am not afraid of his carrying me off, I am not handsome
	enough for that; and he will not swallow me either,
	for my golden hand can smash anything.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Then if you are not afraid, my dove, I will help you to
	the best of my power. But give me your word of honour that
	you will bring me some of the Water of Youth, for it restores
	even to the most aged the beauty and freshness of youth.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I give you my word of honour that I will bring you
	some.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;This then is what you must do. I will give you a
	pin-cushion for a guide; this you throw in front of you, and
	follow whithersoever it goes. It will lead you to the mountain
	that touches the clouds, and which is guarded in Vikher&#8217;s
	absence by his father and mother, the northern blast and the
	south wind. On no account lose sight of the pin-cushion.
	If attacked by the father, the northern blast, and suddenly
	seized with cold, then put on this heat-giving hood: if
	overpowered by burning heat of the south wind, then drink
	from this cooling flagon. Thus by means of the pin-cushion,
	the hood, and the flagon, you will reach the top of the
	mountain where the Princess with the Golden Hair is imprisoned.
	Deal with Vikher as you will, only remember to
	bring me some of the Water of Youth.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Our young hero took the heat-giving hood, the cooling
	<a class="pagenum" id="page219" title="219">&nbsp;</a>flagon, and the pin-cushion, and, after bidding farewell to old
	Yaga and her two pretty daughters, mounted his steed and
	rode off, following the pin-cushion, which rolled before him
	at a great rate.</p>

	<p>Now a beautiful story is soon told, but the events of
	which it consists do not in real life take place so rapidly.</p>

	<p>When the prince had travelled through two kingdoms,
	he came to a land in which lay a very beautiful valley that
	stretched into the far distance, and above it towered the
	mountain that touches the sky. The summit was so high
	above the earth you might almost fancy it reached the moon.</p>

	<p>The prince dismounted, left his horse to graze, and having
	crossed himself began to follow the pin-cushion up steep and
	rocky paths. When he had got half-way there the north wind
	began to blow, and the cold was so intense that the wood of
	the trees split up and the breath froze: he felt chilled to the
	heart. But he quickly put on the heat-giving hood, and
	cried:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;O Heat-Giving Hood, see I fly now to thee,</p>
		<p class="i2">Lend me quickly thine aid;</p>
		<p>O hasten to warm ere the cold has killed me,</p>
		<p class="i2">With thee I&#8217;m not afraid.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>The northern blast blew with redoubled fury, but to no
	purpose. For the prince was so hot that he streamed with
	perspiration, and indeed was obliged to unbutton his coat and
	fan himself.</p>

	<p>Here the pin-cushion stopped upon a small snow-covered
	mound. The prince cleared away the snow, beneath which lay
	the frozen bodies of two young men, and he knew them to be
	those of his lost brothers. Having knelt beside them and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page220" title="220">&nbsp;</a>prayed he turned to follow the pin-cushion, which had already
	started, and was rolling ever higher and higher. On reaching
	the top of the mountain he saw a silver palace supported on a
	cock&#8217;s foot, and at one of the windows, shining in the sun&#8217;s
	rays, a head of golden hair which could belong to no one but
	the princess. Suddenly a hot wind began to blow from the
	south, and the heat became so intense that leaves withered
	and dropped from the trees, the grass dried up, and large
	cracks appeared in several places of the earth&#8217;s surface. Thirst,
	heat, and weariness began to tell upon the young prince, so he
	took the cooling flagon from his pocket and cried:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Flagon, bring me quick relief</p>
		<p class="i2">From this parching heat;</p>
		<p>In thy draught I have belief,</p>
		<p class="i2">Coolness it will mete.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>After drinking deeply he felt stronger than ever, and so
	continued to ascend. Not only was he relieved from the great
	heat, but was even obliged to button up his coat to keep
	himself warm.</p>

	<div class="image"><a class="pagenum disguise" id="page221" title="221">&nbsp;</a>
		<a href="images/illo-37.png"><img src="images/illo-37-th.png" width="339" height="499" alt="A man climbs stairs, reaching for a princess." /></a>
		<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page222" title="222">&nbsp;</a>[Blank Page] -->
	</div>

	<p>The pin-cushion still led the way, ever climbing higher and
	higher, while the prince followed close behind. After crossing
	the region of clouds they came to the topmost peak of the
	mountain. Here the prince came close to the palace, which
	can only be likened to a dream of perfect beauty. It was
	supported on a cock&#8217;s foot, and was built entirely of silver,
	except for its steel gates and roof of solid gold. Before the
	entrance was a deep precipice over which none but the birds
	could pass. As the prince gazed upon the splendid building
	the princess leaned out of one of the windows, and seeing him  <!-- Original location of pages 221 & 222 -->
	<a class="pagenum" id="page223" title="223">&nbsp;</a>light shone from her sparkling eyes, her lovely hair floated in
	the wind, and the scent of her sweet breath filled the air.
	The prince sprang forward and cried out:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Silver Palace, oh turn, on thy foot turn thou free,</p>
		<p>To the steep rocks thy back, but thy doors wide to me.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>At these words it revolved creaking, the doorway facing the
	prince. As he entered it returned to its original position.
	The prince went through the palace till he came to a room
	bright as the sun itself, and the walls, floor, and ceiling of
	which consisted of mirrors. He was filled with wonder, for
	instead of one princess he saw twelve, all equally beautiful,
	with the same graceful movements and golden hair. But
	eleven were only reflections of the one real princess. She
	gave a cry of joy on seeing him, and running to meet him,
	said: &#8220;Ah, noble sir, you look like a delivering angel. Surely
	you bring me good news. From what family, city, or country
	have you come? Perhaps my dear father and mother sent
	you in search of me?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No one has sent me, I have come of my own free will
	to rescue you and restore you to your parents.&#8221;</p>

	<p>When he had told her all that had passed she said, &#8220;Your
	devotion, prince, is very great; may God bless your attempt.
	But Vikher the hurricane is unconquerable, so, if life be dear
	to you, fly. Leave this place before his return, which I
	expect every minute; he will kill you with one glance of his
	eyes.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;If I should not succeed in saving you, sweet princess,
	life can be no longer dear to me. But I am full of hope,
	and I beg you first to give me some of the Strength-Giving
	<a class="pagenum" id="page224" title="224">&nbsp;</a>Water from the Heroic Well, for this is drunk by the
	hurricane.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The princess drew a bucketful of water, which the young
	man emptied at one draught and then asked for another.
	This astonished her somewhat, but she gave it him, and
	when he had drunk it he said, &#8220;Allow me, princess, to sit
	down for a moment to take breath.&#8221;</p>

	<p>She gave him an iron chair, but directly he sat down
	it broke into a thousand pieces. She then brought him
	the chair used by Vikher himself, but although it was
	made of the strongest steel, it bent and creaked beneath the
	prince&#8217;s weight.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now you see,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that I have grown heavier
	than your unconquerable hurricane: so take courage, with
	God&#8217;s help and your good wishes I shall overcome him. In
	the meantime tell me how you pass your time here.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Alas! in bitter tears and sad reflections. My only
	consolation is that I have been able to keep my persecutor
	at a distance, for he vainly implores me to marry him.
	Two years have now passed away, and yet none of his efforts
	to win my consent have been successful. Last time he went
	away he told me that if on his return he had not guessed the
	riddles I set him (the correct explanation of these being the
	condition I have made for his marrying me), he would set
	them aside, and marry me in spite of my objections.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ah, then I am just in time. I will be the priest on
	that occasion, and give him Death for a bride.&#8221;</p>

	<p>At that moment a horrible whistling was heard.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Be on your guard, prince,&#8221; cried she, &#8220;here comes the
	hurricane.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page225" title="225">&nbsp;</a>The palace spun rapidly round, fearful sounds filled
	the building, thousands of ravens and birds of ill omen
	croaked loudly and flapped their wings, and all the doors
	opened with a tremendous noise.</p>

	<p>Vikher, mounted on his winged horse that breathed fire,
	leapt into the mirrored room, then stopped amazed at the
	sight before him. He was indeed the hurricane, with the
	body of a giant and the head of a dragon, and as he gazed
	his horse pranced and beat his wings.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What is your business here, stranger?&#8221; he shouted: and
	the sound of his voice was like unto a lion&#8217;s roar.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am your enemy, and I want your blood,&#8221; replied the
	prince calmly.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Your boldness amuses me. At the same time, if you
	do not depart at once I will take you in my left hand and
	crush every bone in your body with my right.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Try, if you dare, woman-stealer,&#8221; he answered.</p>

	<p>Vikher roared, breathing fire in his rage, and with his
	mouth wide open threw himself upon the prince, intending to
	swallow him. But the latter stepped lightly aside, and putting
	his golden hand down his enemy&#8217;s throat, seized him by the
	tongue and dashed him against the wall with such force that
	the monster bounded against it like a ball, and died within a
	few moments, shedding torrents of blood.</p>

	<p>The prince then drew from different springs the water
	that <em>restores</em>, that <em>revives</em>, and that <em>makes young</em>, and taking
	the unconscious girl in his arms he led the winged horse to
	the door and said:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Silver Palace, oh turn, on thy foot turn thou free,</p>
		<p>To the steep rocks thy back, the courtyard may I see.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page226" title="226">&nbsp;</a>Whereupon the palace creaked round on the cock&#8217;s foot,
	and the door opened on the courtyard. Mounting the horse
	he placed the princess before him, for she had by this time
	recovered from her swoon, and cried:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Fiery Horse with strength of wing,</p>
		<p class="i2">I am now your lord;</p>
		<p>Do my will in everything,</p>
		<p class="i2">Be your law my word.</p>
		<p>Where I point there you must go</p>
		<p>At once, at once. The way you know.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>And he pointed to the place where his brothers lay frozen
	in death. The horse rose, pranced, beat the air with his
	wings, then, lifting himself high in the air, came down gently
	where the two princes were lying. The Prince with the
	Golden Hand sprinkled their bodies with the Life-Restoring
	Water, and instantly the pallor of death disappeared, leaving
	in its place the natural colour. He then sprinkled them with
	the Water that Revives, after which they opened their eyes,
	got up, and looking round said, &#8220;How well we have slept:
	but what has happened? And how is it we see the lovely
	princess we sought in the society of a young man, a perfect
	stranger to us?&#8221;</p>

	<p>The Prince with the Golden Hand explained everything,
	embraced his brothers tenderly, and taking them with him on
	his horse, showed the latter that he wished to go in the direction
	of Yaga&#8217;s cottage. The horse rose up, pranced, lifted himself
	in the air, then, beating his wings far above the highest forests,
	descended close by the cottage. The prince said:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Little cot, turn around, on thy foot turn thou free,</p>
		<p>To the forest thy back, but thy door wide to me.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page227" title="227">&nbsp;</a>The cottage began to creak without delay, and turned round
	with the floor facing the travellers. Old Yaga was on the
	look-out, and came to meet them. As soon as she got the
	Water of Youth she sprinkled herself with it, and instantly
	everything about her that was old and ugly became young and
	charming. So pleased was she to be young again that she
	kissed the prince&#8217;s hands and said, &#8220;Ask of me anything you
	like, I will refuse you nothing.&#8221;</p>

	<p>At that moment her two beautiful young daughters happened
	to look out of the window, upon which the two elder
	princes, who were admiring them, said, &#8220;Will you give us your
	daughters for wives?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That I will, with pleasure,&#8221; said she, and beckoned
	them to her. Then curtseying to her future sons-in-law, she
	laughed merrily and vanished. They placed their brides
	before them on the same horse, while the Prince with the
	Golden Hand, pointing to where he wished to go, said:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Fiery Horse with strength of wing,</p>
		<p class="i2">I am now your lord;</p>
		<p>Do my will in everything,</p>
		<p class="i2">Be your law my word.</p>
		<p>Where I point there you must go</p>
		<p>At once, at once. The way you know.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>The horse rose up, pranced, flapped his wings, and flew
	far above the forest. An hour or two later he descended
	before the palace of the Golden-Haired Princess&#8217;s parents.
	When the king and queen saw their only daughter who had
	so long been lost to them, they ran to meet her with exclamations
	of joy and kissed her gratefully and lovingly, at the same
	<a class="pagenum" id="page228" title="228">&nbsp;</a>time thanking the prince who had restored her to them. And
	when they heard the story of his adventures they said: &#8220;You,
	Prince with the Golden Hand, shall receive our beloved
	daughter in marriage, with the half of our kingdom, and the
	right of succession to the remainder after us. Let us, too,
	add to the joy of this day by celebrating the weddings of your
	two brothers.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The Princess with the Golden Hair kissed her father
	lovingly and said, &#8220;My much honoured and noble sire and
	lord, the prince my bridegroom knows of the vow I made
	when carried off by the hurricane, that I would only give my
	hand to him who could answer aright my six enigmas: it
	would be impossible for the Princess with the Golden Hair
	to break her word.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The king was silent, but the prince said, &#8220;Speak, sweet
	princess, I am listening.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;This is my first riddle: &#8216;Two of my extremities form a
	sharp point, the two others a ring, in my centre is a screw.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;A pair of scissors,&#8221; answered he.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well guessed. This is the second: &#8216;I make the round
	of the table on only one foot, but if I am wounded the evil
	is beyond repair.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;A glass of wine.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Right. This is the third: &#8216;I have no tongue, and yet I
	answer faithfully; I am not seen, yet every one hears me.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;An echo.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;True. This is the fourth: &#8216;Fire cannot light me; brush
	cannot sweep me; no painter can paint me; no hiding-place
	secure me.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Sunshine.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page229" title="229">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;The very thing. This is the fifth: &#8216;I existed before the
	creation of Adam. I am always changing in succession the
	two colours of my dress. Thousands of years have gone by,
	but I have remained unaltered both in colour and form.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;It must be time, including day and night.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You have succeeded in guessing the five most difficult,
	the last is the easiest of all. &#8216;By day a ring, by night a
	serpent; he who guesses this shall be my bridegroom.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;It is a girdle.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now they are all guessed,&#8221; said she, and gave her hand
	to the young prince.</p>

	<p>They knelt before the king and queen to receive their
	blessing. The three weddings were celebrated that same
	evening, and a messenger mounted the winged horse to carry
	the good news to the parents of the young princes and to
	bring them back as guests. Meanwhile a magnificent feast
	was prepared, and invitations were sent to all their friends and
	acquaintances. And from that evening until the next morning
	they ceased not to feast and drink and dance. I too was
	a guest, and feasted with the rest; but though I ate and
	drank, the wine only ran down my beard, and my throat
	remained dry.</p>

	</div>

	<p class="second_title">IMPERISHABLE</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Once</span> upon a time, ever so many years ago, there lived
	a little old man and a little old woman. Very old
	indeed were they, for they had lived nearly a hundred years.
	But they took neither joy nor pleasure in anything, and this
	because they had no children. They were now about to
	keep the seventy-fifth anniversary of their wedding day, known
	as the Diamond Wedding, but no guests were invited to share
	their simple feast.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page234" title="234">&nbsp;</a>As they sat side by side they went over in memory the
	years of their long life, and as they did so they felt sure that
	it was to punish them for their sins that God had denied them
	the sweet happiness of having children about them, and as
	they thought their tears fell fast. At that moment some one
	knocked.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Who is there?&#8221; cried the old woman, and ran to open
	the door. There stood a little old man leaning on a stick,
	and white as a dove.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; asked the old woman.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Charity,&#8221; answered he.</p>

	<p>The good old woman was kind-hearted, and she cut
	her last loaf in two, giving one half to the beggar, who said,
	&#8220;I see you have been weeping, good wife, and I know the
	reason of your tears; but cheer up, by God&#8217;s grace you shall
	be comforted. Though poor and childless to-day, to-morrow
	you shall have family and fortune.&#8221;</p>

	<p>When the old woman heard this she was overjoyed, and
	fetching her husband they both went to the door to invite the
	old man in. But he was gone, and though they searched for
	him in every direction they found nothing but his stick lying
	on the ground. For it was not a poor old beggar, but an
	angel of God who had knocked. Our good friends did not
	know this, so they picked up the stick and hurried off to find
	the old man, with the purpose of returning it. But it seemed
	as if the stick, like its master, were endowed with some
	marvellous power, for whenever the old man or the old woman
	tried to pick it up it slipped out of their hands and rolled
	along the ground. Thus they followed it into a forest, and
	at the foot of a shrub which stood close by a stream it
	<a class="pagenum" id="page235" title="235">&nbsp;</a>disappeared. They hunted all round the shrub thinking to
	find the stick there, but instead of the stick they came upon
	a bird&#8217;s nest containing twelve eggs, and from the shape
	of the shells it seemed as if the young ones were ready to
	come forth.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Pick up the eggs,&#8221; said the old man, &#8220;they will make us
	an omelette for our wedding feast.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The old woman grumbled a little, but she took the nest
	and carried it home in the skirt of her gown. Fancy their
	astonishment when at the end of twelve hours there came out,
	not unfledged birdlings, but twelve pretty little boys. Then
	the shells broke into tiny fragments which were changed into
	as many gold pieces. Thus, as had been foretold, the old man
	and his wife found both family and fortune.</p>

	<p>Now these twelve boys were most extraordinary children.
	Directly they came out of the shells they seemed to be at least
	three months old, such a noise did they make, crying and
	kicking about. The youngest of all was a very big baby with
	black eyes, red cheeks, and curly hair, and so lively and active
	that the old woman could hardly keep him in his cradle at all.
	In twelve hours&#8217; time the children seemed to be a year old,
	and could walk about and eat anything.</p>

	<p>Then the old woman made up her mind that they should
	be baptized, and thereupon sent her husband to fetch priest
	and organist without delay; and the diamond wedding was
	celebrated at the same time as the christening. For a short
	time their joy was clouded over by the disappearance of the
	youngest boy, who was also the best-looking, and his parents&#8217;
	favourite. They had begun to weep and mourn for him as if
	he were lost, when suddenly he was seen to come from out of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page236" title="236">&nbsp;</a>the sleeves of the priest&#8217;s cassock, and was heard to speak
	these words: &#8220;Never fear, dear parents, your beloved son will
	not perish.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The old woman kissed him fondly and handed him to his
	godfather, who presented him to the priest. So they had named
	him <em>Niezguinek</em>, that is, <em>Imperishable</em>. The twelve boys went on
	growing at the rate of six weeks every hour, and at the end of
	two years were fine strong young men. Niezguinek, especially,
	was of extraordinary size and strength. The good old people
	lived happily and peacefully at home while their sons worked
	in the fields. On one occasion the latter went ploughing; and
	while the eleven eldest used the ordinary plough and team
	of oxen, Niezguinek made his own plough, and it had twelve
	ploughshares and twelve handles, and to it were harnessed
	twelve team of the strongest working oxen. The others
	laughed at him, but he did not mind, and turned up as much
	ground as his eleven brothers together.</p>

	<p>Another time when they went haymaking and his brothers
	used the ordinary scythes, he carried one with twelve blades,
	and managed it so cleverly, in spite of the jests of his companions,
	that he cut as much grass as all of them together.
	And again, when they went to turn over the hay, Niezguinek
	used a rake with twelve teeth, and so cleared twelve plots of
	ground with every stroke. His haycock, too, was as large as
	a hill in comparison with those of his brothers. Now, the
	day after the making of the haycocks the old man and his
	wife happened to be in the fields, and they noticed that one
	haycock had disappeared; so thinking wild horses had made
	off with it, they advised their sons to take turns in watching
	the place.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page237" title="237">&nbsp;</a>The eldest took his turn first, but after having watched
	all night fell asleep towards morning, when he awoke to
	find another haycock missing. The second son was not
	more fortunate in preventing the disappearance of the hay,
	while the others succeeded no better; in fact, of all the
	twelve haycocks, there only remained the largest, Niezguinek&#8217;s,
	and even that had been meddled with.</p>

	<p>When it was the youngest&#8217;s turn to watch, he went to
	the village blacksmith and got him to make an iron club
	weighing two hundred and sixty pounds; so heavy was it
	that the blacksmith and his assistants could hardly turn it
	on the anvil. In order to test it, Niezguinek whirled it
	round his head and threw it up in the air, and when it
	had nearly reached the ground he caught it on his knee,
	upon which it was smashed to atoms. He then ordered
	another weighing four hundred and eighty pounds, and
	this the blacksmith and his men could not even move.
	Niezguinek had helped them to make it, and when finished
	he tested it in the same manner as the first. Finding it
	did not break he kept it, and had in addition a noose
	plaited with twelve strong ropes. Towards nightfall he
	went to the field, crouched down behind his haycock, crossed
	himself, and waited to see what would happen. At midnight
	there was a tremendous noise which seemed to come
	from the east, while in that direction appeared a bright
	light. Then a white mare, with twelve colts as white as
	herself, trotted up to the haycock and began to eat it.
	Niezguinek came out of his hiding-place, and throwing the
	noose over the mare&#8217;s neck, jumped on her back and struck
	her with his heavy club. The terrified creature gave the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page238" title="238">&nbsp;</a>signal to the colts to escape, but she herself, hindered by
	the noose, out of breath, and wounded by the club, could not
	follow, but sank down on the earth saying, &#8220;Do not choke
	me, Niezguinek.&#8221;</p>

	<p>He marvelled to hear her speak human language, and
	loosened the noose. When she had taken breath she said,
	&#8220;Knight, if you give me my liberty you shall never repent
	it. My husband, the Dappled Horse with Golden Mane,
	will cruelly revenge himself upon you when he knows I am
	your prisoner; his strength and swiftness are so great you
	could not escape him. In exchange for my freedom I will
	give you my twelve colts, who will serve you and your
	brothers faithfully.&#8221;</p>

	<p>On hearing their mother neigh the colts returned and
	stood with bent heads before the young man, who released
	the mare, and led them home. The brothers were delighted
	to see Niezguinek return with twelve beautiful white horses,
	and each took the one that pleased his fancy most, while
	the thinnest and weakest-looking was left for the youngest.</p>

	<div class="image"><a class="pagenum disguise" id="page239" title="239">&nbsp;</a>

	</div>

	<p>The old couple were happy in the thought that their son
	was brave as well as strong. One day it occurred to the old
	woman that she would like to see them all married, and to
	have the house merry with her daughters-in-law and their
	children. So she called upon her gossips and friends to talk
	the matter over, and finally persuaded her husband to be of
	the same opinion. He called his sons around him and
	addressed them thus: &#8220;Listen to me, my sons: in a certain
	country lives a celebrated witch known as old Yaga. She
	is lame, and travels about in an oaken trough. She supports
	herself on iron crutches, and when she goes abroad carefully  <!-- Original location of pages 239 & 240 -->
	<a class="pagenum" id="page241" title="241">&nbsp;</a>removes all traces of her steps with a broom. This old witch
	has twelve beautiful daughters who have large dowries; do
	your best to win them for your wives. Do not return without
	bringing them with you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Both parents blessed their sons, who, mounting their horses,
	were soon out of sight. All but Niezguinek, who, left alone,
	went to the stable and began to shed tears.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why do you weep?&#8221; asked his horse.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think I have good reason?&#8221; replied he.
	&#8220;Here I have to go a long long way in search of a wife,
	and you, my friend, are so thin and weak that were I to depend
	upon your strength I should never be able to join my
	brothers.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Do not despair, Niezguinek,&#8221; said the horse, &#8220;not only
	will you overtake your brothers, but you will leave them far
	behind. I am the son of the Dappled Horse with the Golden
	Mane, and if you will do exactly as I tell you I shall be given
	the same power as he. You must kill me and bury me under
	a layer of earth and manure, then sow some wheat over me,
	and when the corn is ripe it must be gathered and some of it
	placed near my body.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Niezguinek threw his arms round his horse&#8217;s neck and kissed
	him fondly, then led him into a yard and killed him with one
	blow of his club. The horse staggered a moment and then
	fell dead. His master covered him with a layer of manure
	and earth, upon which he sowed wheat, as had been directed.
	It was immediately watered by a gentle rain, and warmed by
	the heat of the sun&#8217;s rays. The corn took root and ripened
	so quickly that on the twelfth day Niezguinek set to work to
	cut, thresh, and winnow it. So abundant was it that he was
	<a class="pagenum" id="page242" title="242">&nbsp;</a>able to give eleven measures to his parents, and keeping one
	for himself, spread it before his horse&#8217;s bones. In a very
	short time the horse moved his head, sniffed the air, and began
	to devour the wheat. As soon as it was finished he sprang
	up, and was so full of life that he wanted to jump over the
	fence in one bound: but Niezguinek held him by the mane,
	and getting lightly on his back, said: &#8220;Halt there, my spirited
	steed, I do not want others to have the benefit of all the
	trouble I have had with you. Carry me to old Yaga&#8217;s house.&#8221;</p>

	<p>He was of a truth a most magnificent horse, big and strong,
	with eyes that flashed like lightning. He leapt up into the
	air as high as the clouds, and the next moment descended
	in the middle of a field, saying to his master: &#8220;As we have
	first to see old Yaga, from whom we are still a great way
	off, we can stop here for a short time: take food and rest,
	I will do the same. Your brothers will be obliged to pass
	us, for we are a good way in front of them. When they
	come you can go on together to visit the old witch: remember,
	though it is difficult to get into her house, it is
	much more difficult still to get out. But if you would be
	perfectly safe, take from under my saddle a brush, a scarf,
	and a handkerchief. They will be of use in helping you to
	escape; for when you unroll the scarf, a river will flow between
	you and your enemy; if you shake the brush it will become
	a thick forest; and by waving the handkerchief it will be
	changed into a lake. After you have been received into
	Yaga&#8217;s house, and your brothers have stabled their horses
	and gone to bed, I will tell you how to act.&#8221;</p>

	<p>For twelve days Niezguinek and his horse rested and
	gained strength, and at the end of the time the eleven
	<a class="pagenum" id="page243" title="243">&nbsp;</a>brothers came up. They wondered greatly to see the
	youngest, and said, &#8220;Where on earth did you come from?
	And whose horse is that?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I have come from home. The horse is the same I
	chose at first. We have been waiting here twelve days; let
	us go on together now.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Within a short time they came to a house surrounded
	by a high oaken paling, at the gate of which they knocked.
	Old Yaga peeped out through a chink in the fence and
	cried, &#8220;Who are you? What do you want?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;We are twelve brothers come to ask the twelve daughters
	of Yaga in marriage. If she is willing to be our mother-in-law,
	let her open the door.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The door was opened and Yaga appeared. She was a
	frightful-looking creature, old as the hills; and being one of
	those monsters who feed on human flesh, the unfortunate
	wretches who once entered her house never came out again.
	She had a lame leg, and because of this she leaned on a
	great iron crutch, and when she went out removed all traces
	of her steps with a broom.</p>

	<p>She received the young travellers very graciously, shut
	the gate of the courtyard behind them, and led them into
	the house. Niezguinek&#8217;s brothers dismounted, and taking
	their horses to the stables, tied them up to rings made of
	silver; the youngest fastened his to a copper ring. The old
	witch served her guests with a good supper, and gave them
	wine and hydromel to drink. Then she made up twelve
	beds on the right side of the room for the travellers, and
	on the left side twelve beds for her daughters.</p>

	<p>All were soon asleep except Niezguinek. He had been
	<a class="pagenum" id="page244" title="244">&nbsp;</a>warned beforehand by his horse of the danger that threatened
	them, and now he got up quietly and changed the positions
	of the twenty-four beds, so that the brothers lay to the left
	side of the room, and Yaga&#8217;s daughters to the right. At
	midnight, old Yaga cried out in a hoarse voice, &#8220;Guzla, play.
	Sword, strike.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then were heard strains of sweet music, to which the old
	woman beat time from her oaken trough. At the same
	moment a slender sword descended into the room, and
	passing over to the beds on the right, cut off the heads of
	the girls one by one: after which it danced about and
	flashed in the darkness.</p>

	<p>When the dawn broke the guzla ceased playing, the
	sword disappeared, and silence reigned. Then Niezguinek
	softly aroused his brothers, and they all went out without
	making any noise. Each mounted his horse, and when they
	had broken open the yard gate they made their escape at full
	speed. Old Yaga, thinking she heard footsteps, got up and ran
	into the room where her daughters lay dead. At the dreadful
	sight she gnashed her teeth, barked like a dog, tore out her
	hair by handfuls, and seating herself in her trough as in a car,
	set off after the fugitives. She had nearly reached them, and
	was already stretching out her hand to seize them, when
	Niezguinek unrolled his magic scarf, and instantly a deep
	river flowed between her and the horsemen. Not being able
	to cross it she stopped on the banks, and howling savagely
	began to drink it up.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Before you have swallowed all that river you will burst,
	you wicked old witch,&#8221; cried Niezguinek. Then he rejoined
	his brothers.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page245" title="245">&nbsp;</a>But the old woman drank all the water, crossed the bed of
	the river in her trough, and soon came near the young people.
	Niezguinek shook his handkerchief, and a lake immediately
	spread out between them. So she was again obliged to stop,
	and shrieking with rage began to drink up the water.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Before you have drunk that lake dry you will have burst
	yourself,&#8221; said Niezguinek, and rode after his brothers.</p>

	<p>The old vixen drank up part of the water, and turning the
	remainder into a thick fog, hastened along in her trough. She
	was once more close upon the young men when Niezguinek,
	without a moment&#8217;s delay, seized his brush, and as he waved
	it in the air a thick forest rose between them. For a time
	the witch was at a loss to know what to do. On one side
	she saw Niezguinek and his brothers rapidly disappearing,
	while she stood on the other hindered by the branches and
	torn by the thorns of the thick bushes, unable either to advance
	or retreat. Foaming with rage, with fire flashing from
	her eyes, she struck right and left with her crutches, crashing
	trees on all sides, but before she could clear a way those she
	was in pursuit of had got more than a hundred miles ahead.</p>

	<p>So she was forced to give up, and grinding her teeth,
	howling, and tearing out her hair, she threw after the fugitives
	such flaming glances from her eyes that she set the forest on
	fire, and taking the road home was soon lost to sight.</p>

	<p>The travellers, seeing the flames, guessed what had happened,
	and thanked God for having preserved them from such
	great dangers. They continued their journey, and by eventide
	arrived at the top of a steep hill. There they saw a town
	besieged by foreign troops, who had already destroyed the
	outer part, and only awaited daylight to take it by storm.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page246" title="246">&nbsp;</a>The twelve brothers kept out of sight behind the enemy;
	and when they had rested and turned out their horses to graze
	all went to sleep except Niezguinek, who kept watch without
	closing an eye. When everything was perfectly still he got
	up, and calling his horse, said, &#8220;Listen; yonder in that tent
	sleeps the king of this besieging army, and he dreams of the
	victory he hopes for on the morrow: how could we send all
	the soldiers to sleep and get possession of his person?&#8221;</p>

	<p>The horse replied, &#8220;You will find some dried leaves of
	the herb of Sleep in the pocket of the saddle. Mount upon
	my back and hover round the camp, spreading fragments of
	the plant. That will cause all the soldiers to fall into a sound
	sleep, after which you can carry out your plans.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Niezguinek mounted his horse, pronouncing these magic
	words:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Marvel of strength and of beauty so white,</p>
		<p class="i2">Horse of my heart, let us go;</p>
		<p>Rise in the air, like a bird take thy flight,</p>
		<p class="i2">Haste to the camp of the foe.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>The horse glanced upwards as if he saw some one beckoning
	to him from the clouds, then rose rapidly as a bird on
	the wing and hovered over the camp. Niezguinek took
	handfuls of the herb of Sleep from the saddle-pockets and
	sprinkled it all about. Upon which all in the camp, including
	the sentinels, fell at once into a heavy sleep. Niezguinek
	alighted, entered the tent, and carried off the sleeping king
	without any difficulty. He then returned to his brothers,
	unharnessed his horse and lay down to rest, placing the royal
	prisoner near him. His majesty slept on as if nothing
	unusual had taken place.</p>

	<div class="image"><a class="pagenum disguise" id="page247" title="247">&nbsp;</a>
		<a href="images/illo-40.png"><img src="images/illo-40-th.png" width="317" height="499" alt="A witch in flies in a trough, carrying a broom." /></a>
		<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page248" title="248">&nbsp;</a>[Blank Page] -->
	</div>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page249" title="249">&nbsp;</a>At daybreak the soldiers of the besieging army awoke, and
	not being able to find their king, were seized with such a
	panic of terror that they retreated in great disorder. The
	ruler of the besieged city would not at first believe that the
	enemy had really disappeared, and indeed went himself to
	see if it was true: of a truth there remained nothing of the
	enemy&#8217;s camp but a few deserted tents whitening on the plain.
	At that moment Niezguinek came up with his brothers, and
	said, &#8220;Sire, the enemy has fled, and we were unable to detain
	them, but here is their king whom we have made prisoner,
	and whom I deliver up to you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The ruler replied, &#8220;I see, indeed, that you are a brave
	man among brave men, and I will reward you. This royal
	prisoner is worth a large ransom to me; so speak,&#8212;what would
	you like me to do for you?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I should wish, sire, that my brothers and I might enter
	the service of your majesty.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am quite willing,&#8221; answered the king. Then, having
	placed his prisoner in charge of his guards, he made Niezguinek
	general, and placed him at the head of a division of
	his army; the eleven brothers were given the rank of officers.</p>

	<p>When Niezguinek appeared in uniform, and with sabre
	in hand mounted his splendid charger, he looked so handsome
	and conducted the man&oelig;uvres so well that he surpassed
	all the other chiefs in the country, thus causing much
	jealousy, even among his own brothers, for they were vexed
	that the youngest should outshine them, and so determined
	to ruin him.</p>

	<p>In order to accomplish this they imitated his handwriting,
	and placed such a note before the king&#8217;s door while
	<a class="pagenum" id="page250" title="250">&nbsp;</a>Niezguinek was engaged elsewhere. When the king went out
	he found the letter, and calling Niezguinek to him, said, &#8220;I
	should very much like to have the phonic guzla you mention
	in your letter.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;But, sire, I have not written anything about a guzla,&#8221;
	said he.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Read the note then. Is it not in your handwriting?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Niezguinek read:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8220;In a certain country, within the house of old Yaga, is a
		marvellous guzla: if the king wish I will fetch it for him.</p>

		<p class="signature">&#8220;(Signed)  <strong class="special_name">Niezguinek</strong>.&#8221;</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>&#8220;It is true,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that this writing resembles mine,
	but it is a forgery, for I never wrote it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said the king, &#8220;as you were able to take
	my enemy prisoner you will certainly be able to succeed in
	getting old Yaga&#8217;s guzla: go then, and do not return without
	it, or you will be executed.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Niezguinek bowed and went out. He went straight to the
	stable, where he found his charger looking very sad and thin,
	his head drooping before the trough, the hay untouched.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What is the matter with you, my good steed? What
	grieves you?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I grieve for us both, for I foresee a long and perilous
	journey.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You are right, old fellow, but we have to go. And what
	is more, we have to take away and bring here old Yaga&#8217;s guzla;
	and how shall we do it, seeing that she knows us?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;We shall certainly succeed if you do as I tell you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then the horse gave him certain instructions, and when
	<a class="pagenum" id="page251" title="251">&nbsp;</a>Niezguinek had led him out of the stable and mounted he
	said:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Marvel of strength and of beauty so white,</p>
		<p class="i2">Horse of my heart, do not wait on the road;</p>
		<p>Rise in the air, like a bird take thy flight,</p>
		<p class="i2">Haste to the wicked old Yaga&#8217;s abode.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>The horse arose in the air as if he heard some one calling
	to him from the clouds, and flitting rapidly along passed over
	several kingdoms within a few hours, thus reaching old Yaga&#8217;s
	dwelling before midnight. Niezguinek threw the leaves of
	Sleep in at the window, and by means of another wonderful
	herb caused all the doors of the house to open. On entering
	he found old Yaga fast asleep, with her trough and iron
	crutches beside her, while above her head hung the magic
	sword and guzla.</p>

	<p>While the old witch lay snoring with all her might, Niezguinek
	took the guzla and leapt on his horse, crying:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Marvel of strength and of beauty so white,</p>
		<p class="i2">Horse of my heart, while I sing,</p>
		<p>Rise in the air, like a bird take thy flight,</p>
		<p class="i2">Haste to the court of my king.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>Just as if the horse had seen something in the clouds, he
	rose swift as an arrow, and flew through the air, above the fogs.
	The same day about noon he neighed before his own manger
	in the royal stable, and Niezguinek went in to the king and
	presented him with the guzla. On pronouncing the two words,
	&#8220;Guzla, play,&#8221; strains of music so gay and inspiriting were
	heard that all the courtiers began dancing with one another.
	The sick who listened were cured of their diseases, those who
	were in trouble and grief forgot their sorrows, and all living
	<a class="pagenum" id="page252" title="252">&nbsp;</a>creatures were thrilled with a gladness such as they had never
	felt before. The king was beside himself with joy; he loaded
	Niezguinek with honours and presents, and, in order to have
	him always at court, raised him to a higher rank in the army.
	In this new post he had many under him, and he showed
	much exactitude in drill and other matters, punishing somewhat
	severely when necessary. He made, too, no difference
	in the treatment of his brothers, which angered them greatly,
	and caused them to be still more jealous and to plot against
	him. So they again imitated his handwriting and composed
	another letter, which they left at the king&#8217;s door. When his
	majesty had read it he called Niezguinek to him and said,
	&#8220;I should much like to have the marvellous sword you speak
	of in your letter.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Sire, I have not written anything about a sword,&#8221; said
	Niezguinek.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, read it for yourself.&#8221; And he read:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8220;In a certain country within the house of old Yaga is a
		sword that strikes of its own accord: if the king would like
		to have it, I will engage to bring it him.</p>

		<p class="signature">&#8220;(Signed) <strong class="special_name">Niezguinek</strong>.&#8221;</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said Niezguinek, &#8220;this writing resembles mine,
	but I never wrote those words.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Never mind, as you succeeded in bringing me the guzla
	you will find no difficulty in obtaining the sword. Start without
	delay, and do not return without it at your peril.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Niezguinek bowed and went to the stable, where he found
	his horse looking very thin and miserable, with his head
	drooping.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page253" title="253">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;What is the matter, my horse? Do you want anything?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am unhappy because I foresee a long and dangerous
	journey.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You are right, for we are ordered to return to Yaga&#8217;s
	house for the sword: but how can we get hold of it? doubtless
	she guards it as the apple of her eye.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The horse answered, &#8220;Do as I tell you and all will be
	right.&#8221; And he gave him certain instructions. Niezguinek
	came out of the stable, saddled his friend, and mounting
	him said:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Marvel of strength and of beauty so white;</p>
		<p class="i2">Horse of my heart, do not wait on the road;</p>
		<p>Rise in the air, like a bird take thy flight,</p>
		<p class="i2">Haste to the wicked old witch&#8217;s abode.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>The horse rose immediately as if he had been beckoned
	to by some one in the clouds, and passing swiftly through the
	air, crossed rivers and mountains, till at midnight he stopped
	before old Yaga&#8217;s house.</p>

	<p>Since the disappearance of the guzla the sword had been
	placed on guard before the house, and whoever came near
	it was cut to pieces.</p>

	<p>Niezguinek traced a circle with holy chalk, and placing
	himself on horseback in the centre of it, said:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Sword who of thyself can smite,</p>
		<p class="i2">I come to brave thy ire;</p>
		<p>Peace or war upon this site</p>
		<p class="i2">Of thee I do require.</p>
		<p>If thou canst conquer, thine my life;</p>
		<p>Should I beat thee, then ends this strife.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page254" title="254">&nbsp;</a>The sword clinked, leapt into the air, and fell to the
	ground divided into a thousand other swords, which ranged
	themselves in battle array and began to attack Niezguinek.
	But in vain; they were powerless to touch him; for on
	reaching the chalk-traced circle they broke like wisps of
	straw. Then the sword-in-chief, seeing how useless it was
	to go on trying to wound him, submitted itself to Niezguinek
	and promised him obedience. Taking the magic weapon in
	his hand, he mounted his horse and said:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Marvel of strength and of beauty so white,</p>
		<p class="i2">Horse of my heart, while I sing,</p>
		<p>Rise in the air, like a bird take thy flight,</p>
		<p class="i2">Back to the court of my king.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>The horse started with renewed courage, and by noon
	was eating his hay in the royal stables. Niezguinek went in
	to the king and presented him with the sword. While
	he was rejoicing over it one of his servants rushed in quite
	out of breath and said, &#8220;Sire, your enemies who attacked
	us last year, and whose king is your prisoner, surround our
	town. Being unable to redeem their sovereign, they have
	come with an immense army, and threaten to destroy us if
	their king is not released without ransom.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The king armed himself with the magic sword, and going
	outside the city walls, said to it, as he pointed to the enemy&#8217;s
	camp, &#8220;Magic Sword, smite the foe.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Immediately the sword clinked, leapt flashing in the air,
	and fell in a thousand blades that threw themselves on the
	camp. One regiment was destroyed during the first attack,
	another was defeated in the same way, while the rest of the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page255" title="255">&nbsp;</a>terrified soldiers fled and completely disappeared. Then the
	king said, &#8220;Sword, return to me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The thousand swords again became one, and so it returned
	to its master&#8217;s hand.</p>

	</div>

	<p>The victorious king came
	home filled with joy. He called
	Niezguinek to him, loaded him
	with gifts, and assuring him of
	his favour, made him the highest
	general of his forces. In carrying
	out the duties of this new
	post Niezguinek was often obliged
	to punish his brothers, who became
	more and more enraged
	against him, and took counsel
	together how they might bring
	about his downfall.</p>

	<p>One day the king found a
	letter by his door, and after reading
	it he called Niezguinek to him
	and said, &#8220;I should very much
	like to see Princess Sudolisu,
	whom you wish to bring me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Sire, I do not know the
	lady, and have never spoken
	to her.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Here, look at your letter.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Niezguinek read:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8220;Beyond the nine kingdoms, far beyond the ocean, within
		<a class="pagenum" id="page256" title="256">&nbsp;</a>a silver vessel with golden masts lives Princess Sudolisu. If
		the king wishes it, I will seek her for him.</p>

		<p class="signature">(Signed) <strong class="special_name">Niezguinek</strong>.&#8221;</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>&#8220;It is true the writing is like unto mine; nevertheless, I
	neither composed the letter nor wrote it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No matter,&#8221; answered the king. &#8220;You will be able to
	get this princess, as you did the guzla and the sword: if not,
	I will have you killed.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Niezguinek bowed and went out. He entered the stable
	where stood his horse looking very weak and sad, with his
	head bent down.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What is the matter, dear horse? Are you in want of
	anything?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am sorrowful,&#8221; answered the horse, &#8220;because I foresee
	a long and difficult journey.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You are right, for we have to go beyond the nine
	kingdoms, and far beyond the ocean, to find Princess Sudolisu.
	Can you tell me what to do?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I will do my best, and if it is God&#8217;s will we shall
	succeed. Bring your club of four hundred and eighty
	pounds weight, and let us be off.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Niezguinek saddled his horse, took his club, and mounting
	said:</p>

		<p>&#8220;Marvel of strength and of beauty so white,</p>
		<p class="i2">Horse of my heart, do not lag on the road;</p>
		<p>Rise in the air, through the clouds take thy flight,</p>
		<p class="i2">Haste to Princess Sudolisu&#8217;s abode.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>Then the horse looked up as if there were something
	he wanted in the clouds, and with a spring flew through
	<a class="pagenum" id="page257" title="257">&nbsp;</a>the air, swift as an arrow; and so by the second day they
	had passed over ten kingdoms, and finding themselves
	beyond the ocean, halted on the shore. Here the horse
	said to Niezguinek, &#8220;Do you see that silver ship with golden
	masts that rides on the waves yonder? That beautiful
	vessel is the home of Princess Sudolisu, youngest daughter
	of old Yaga. For after the witch had lost the guzla and
	magic sword she feared to lose her daughter too: so she
	shut her up in that vessel, and having thrown the key
	thereof into the ocean, sat herself in her oaken trough, where
	with the help of the iron crutches she rows round and
	round the silver ship, warding off tempests, and keeping at
	a distance all other ships that would approach it.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The first thing to be done is to get the diamond key
	that opens the ship. In order to procure this you must kill
	me, and then throw into the water one end of my entrails,
	by which bait you will trap the King of the Lobsters. Do
	not set him free until he has promised to get you the key,
	for it is this key that draws the vessel to you of its own
	accord.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ah, my beloved steed,&#8221; cried Niezguinek, &#8220;how can
	I kill you when I love you as my own brother, and when
	my fate depends upon you entirely?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Do as I tell you; you can bring me to life again, as
	you did before.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Niezguinek caressed his horse, kissed him and wept over
	him; then, raising his mighty club, struck him full on the
	forehead. The poor creature staggered and fell down
	dead. Niezguinek cut him open, and putting an end of
	his entrails in the water, he kept hold of it and hid
	<a class="pagenum" id="page258" title="258">&nbsp;</a>himself in the water-rushes. Soon there came a crowd of
	crawfish, and amongst them a gigantic lobster as large as
	a year-old calf. Niezguinek seized him and threw him on
	the beach. The lobster said, &#8220;I am king of all the crawfish
	tribe. Let me go, and I will give you great riches for
	my ransom.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I do not want your riches,&#8221; answered Niezguinek,
	&#8220;but in exchange for your freedom give me the diamond
	key which belongs to the silver ship with the golden masts,
	for in that vessel dwells Princess Sudolisu.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The King of the Crawfish whistled, upon which myriads of
	his subjects appeared. He spoke to them in their own language,
	and dismissed one, who soon returned with the magic
	diamond key in his claws.</p>

	<p>Niezguinek loosed the King of the Crawfish; and hiding
	himself inside his horse&#8217;s body as he had been instructed, lay
	in wait. At that moment an old raven, followed by all his
	nestlings, happened to pass, and attracted by the horse&#8217;s
	carcase, he called to his young ones to come and feast with
	him. Niezguinek seized the smallest of the birds and held it
	firmly.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Let my birdling go,&#8221; said the old raven, &#8220;I will give you
	in return anything you like to ask.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Fetch me then three kinds of water, the Life-giving, the
	Curing, and the Strengthening.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The old raven started off, and while awaiting his return
	Niezguinek, who still held the ravenling, questioned him as
	to where he had come from and what he had seen on his
	travels, and in this way heard news of his brothers.</p>

	<div class="image"><a class="pagenum disguise" id="page259" title="259">&nbsp;</a>

		<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page260" title="260">&nbsp;</a>[Blank Page] -->
	</div>

	<p>When the father bird returned, carrying with him the  <!-- Original location of pages 259 & 260 -->
	<a class="pagenum" id="page261" title="261">&nbsp;</a>bottles filled with the marvellous waters, he wanted to have
	his nestling back.</p>

	<p>&#8220;One moment more,&#8221; said Niezguinek, &#8220;I want to be
	sure that they are of the right sort.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then he replaced the entrails in the body of his horse and
	sprinkled him first with the Life-giving, then with the Curing,
	and finally with the Strengthening Water; after which his
	beloved steed leapt to his feet full of strength and cried,
	&#8220;Ah! how very soundly I have slept.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Niezguinek released the young raven and said to his horse,
	&#8220;For sure, you would have slept to all eternity, and have
	never seen the sun again, if I had not revived you as you
	taught me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>While speaking he saw the marvellous ship sparkling white
	in the sun. She was made entirely of pure silver, with golden
	masts. The rigging was of silk, the sails of velvet, and the
	whole was enclosed in a casing of inpenetrable steel network.
	Niezguinek sprang down to the water&#8217;s edge armed
	with his club, and rubbing his forehead with the diamond
	key, said:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Riding on the ocean waves a magic ship I see;</p>
		<p>Stop and change thy course, O ship, here I hold the key.</p>
		<p>Obey the signal known to thee,</p>
		<p>And come at once direct to me.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>The vessel turned right round and came at full speed
	towards land, and right on to the bank, where it remained
	motionless.</p>

	<p>Niezguinek smashed in the steel network with his club;
	and opening the doors with the diamond key, there found
	<a class="pagenum" id="page262" title="262">&nbsp;</a>Princess Sudolisu. He made her unconscious with the herb
	Sleep, and lifting her before him on his horse, said:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Marvel of strength and of beauty so white,</p>
		<p class="i2">Horse of my heart, while I sing,</p>
		<p>Swift as an arrow through space take thy flight</p>
		<p class="i2">Straight to the court of my king.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>Then the horse, as if he saw some strange thing in the
	clouds, lifted himself in the air and began to fly through
	space so rapidly that in about two hours he had crossed
	rivers, mountains, and forests, and had reached his journey&#8217;s
	end.</p>

	<p>Although Niezguinek had fallen violently in love with the
	princess himself, he took her straight to the royal palace and
	introduced her to the king.</p>

	<p>Now she was so exquisitely beautiful that the monarch
	was quite dazzled by looking at her, and being thus carried
	away by his admiration, he put his arm round her as if to
	caress her: but she rebuked him severely.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What have I done to offend you, princess? Why do
	you treat me so harshly?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Because in spite of your rank you are ill-bred. You
	neither ask my name nor that of my parents, and you
	think to take possession of me as if I were but a dog or a
	falcon. You must understand that he who would be my
	husband must have triple youth, that of heart, soul, and
	body.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Charming princess, if I could become young again we
	would be married directly.&#8221;</p>

	<p>She replied, &#8220;But I have the means of making you so,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page263" title="263">&nbsp;</a>and by help of this sword in my hand. For with it I will
	pierce you to the heart, then cut up your body into small
	pieces, wash them carefully, and join them together again.
	And if I breathe upon them you will return to life young
	and handsome, just as if you were only twenty years
	of age.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh indeed! I should like to know who would submit to
	that; first make trial of Sir Niezguinek here.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The princess looked at him, whereupon he bowed and
	said, &#8220;Lovely princess, I willingly submit, although I am
	young enough without it. In any case life without you
	would be valueless.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then the princess took a step towards him and killed him
	with her sword. She cut him up in pieces and washed these
	in pure water, after which she joined them together again
	and breathed upon them. Instantly Niezguinek sprang up
	full of life and health, and looked so handsome and bright
	that the old king, who was dreadfully jealous, exclaimed,
	&#8220;Make me, too, young again, princess; do not lose a
	moment.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The princess pierced him to the heart with her sword,
	cut him up into little pieces, and, opening the window,
	threw them out, at the same time calling the king&#8217;s dogs,
	who quickly ate them up. Then she turned to Niezguinek
	and said, &#8220;Proclaim yourself king, and I will be your
	queen.&#8221;</p>

	<p>He followed her advice, and within a short time they
	were married; his brothers, whom he had pardoned, and his
	parents having been invited to the wedding. On their way
	back from the church the magic sword suddenly clinked, and,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page264" title="264">&nbsp;</a>flashing in the air, divided itself into a thousand swords that
	placed themselves on guard as sentinels all round the palace.
	The guzla, too, began to play so sweetly and gaily that every
	living thing began to dance for joy.</p>

	<p>The festival was magnificent. I myself was there, and
	drank freely of wine and mead; and although not a drop went
	into my mouth, my chin was quite wet.</p>

	</div>

	<p class="second_title">OHNIVAK</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">A certain</span> king had a beautiful garden which contained
	a number of very rare trees, but the most rare
	of all was an apple tree. It stood in the middle of the
	garden, and produced one golden apple every day. In the
	morning the blossom unfolded, during the day you might
	watch the fruit grow, and before nightfall the apple was fully
	ripe. The next day the same thing occurred&#8212;indeed, it
	happened regularly every twenty-four hours. Nevertheless,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page268" title="268">&nbsp;</a>no ripe fruit ever remained on the tree on the following day;
	the apple disappeared, no one knew how or when, and this
	deeply grieved the king.</p>

	<p>At last he could bear it no longer, and calling his eldest
	son to him, said: &#8220;My child, I wish you to keep watch in
	the garden to-night, and see if you can find out what becomes
	of my golden apples. I will reward you with the choice of
	all my treasures; if you should be lucky enough to get hold
	of the thief, and bring him to me, I would gladly give you
	half my kingdom.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The young prince girded his trusty sword to his side, and
	with his crossbow on his shoulder and a good stock of well-tempered
	arrows, went into the garden to mount guard. And
	as he sat under the apple tree a great drowsiness came over
	him which he could not resist; his arms dropped, his eyes
	closed, and stretching himself on the grass he slept as soundly
	as if he had been in his own bed at home, nor did he awake
	until day dawn, and then he saw that the apple had disappeared.</p>

	<p>When questioned by his father, he said that no thieves
	had come, but that the apple had vanished all the same. The
	king shook his head, for he did not believe a word of it.
	Then, turning to his second son, he bade him keep watch, and
	promised him a handsome reward if he should catch the thief.</p>

	<p>So the second son armed himself with everything necessary
	and went into the garden. But he succeeded no better than
	his brother, for he could not resist the desire to sleep, and
	when he awoke the apple was no longer there.</p>

	<p>When his father asked him how it disappeared, he replied,
	&#8220;No one took it, it vanished of itself.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page269" title="269">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Now, my dearest one, take your turn,&#8221; said the king to
	his youngest son; &#8220;although you are young, and have less
	experience than your brothers, let us see if you cannot succeed
	where they have failed. If you are willing, go, and may God
	help you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Towards evening, when it began to be dusk, the youngest
	son went into the garden to keep watch. He took with him
	a sword and crossbow, a few well-tempered arrows, and a
	hedgehog&#8217;s skin as a sort of apron, for he thought that while
	sitting under the tree, if he spread the skin over his knees, the
	pricking of the bristles on his hands might keep him awake.
	And so it did, for by this means he was able to resist the
	drowsiness that came over him.</p>

	<p>At midnight Ohnivak, the bird of fire, flew down and
	alighted upon the tree, and was just going off with the apple
	when the prince fixed an arrow to his bow, and letting it fly,
	struck the bird under the wing. Although wounded, it flew
	away, dropping one of its feathers upon the ground. That
	night for the first time the apple remained untouched upon
	the tree.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Have you caught the thief?&#8221; asked the king next day.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Not altogether, but no doubt we shall have him in time.
	I have a bit of his trappings.&#8221; And he gave the king the
	feather, and told him all that had taken place.</p>

	<p>The king was charmed with the feather; so lovely and
	bright was it that it illumined all the galleries of the palace,
	and they needed no other light.</p>

	<p>The courtiers told the king that the feather could only
	belong to Ohnivak, the bird of fire, and that it was worth
	all the rest of the royal treasures put together.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page270" title="270">&nbsp;</a>From that time Ohnivak came no more to the garden,
	and the apples remained untouched. Yet the king could
	think of nothing else but how to possess this marvellous bird.
	At last, beginning to despair of ever seeing it, he was filled
	with melancholy, and would remain for hours in deep thought;
	thus he became really ill, and every day continued to grow
	worse.</p>

	<p>One day he summoned his three sons before him and
	said, &#8220;My dear children, you see the sad state I am in. If
	I could but hear the bird Ohnivak sing just once I should
	be cured of this disease of the heart; otherwise it will be
	my death. Whichever of you shall succeed in catching
	Ohnivak alive and inducing him to sing to me, to him I will
	give half of my kingdom and the heirship to the throne.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Having taken leave of their father the brothers set off.
	They travelled together until they came to a part of the forest
	where the road branched off in three directions.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Which turning shall we take?&#8221; asked the eldest.</p>

	<p>The second brother answered, &#8220;We are three, and three
	roads lie before us; let us each choose one, thus we shall
	treble our chances of finding the bird, for we shall seek it
	in three different countries.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;That is a good idea, but how shall each one decide
	which way to choose?&#8221;</p>

	<p>The youngest brother said, &#8220;I will leave the choice to
	you two, and will take whichever road you leave me.&#8221;</p>

	<div class="image"><a class="pagenum disguise" id="page271" title="271">&nbsp;</a>
		<a href="images/illo-44.png"><img src="images/illo-44-th.png" width="320" height="477" alt="Three young men surround an old man reclining on a divan." /></a>
		<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page272" title="272">&nbsp;</a>[Blank Page] -->
	</div>

	<p>So each took the road that chance decided for him,
	agreeing that when their mission was over they would return
	to the point of departure. In order to recognise the place
	again each one planted the branch of a tree at the cross  <!-- Original location of pages 271 & 272 -->
	<a class="pagenum" id="page273" title="273">&nbsp;</a>roads, and they believed that he whose branch should take root
	and grow into a big tree would be successful in the quest.</p>

	<p>When each one had planted his branch at the chosen
	road they started off. The eldest rode on, and never stopped
	until he reached the top of a high mountain; there he dismounted,
	and let his horse graze while he ate his breakfast.
	Suddenly a red fox came up, and speaking in the language
	of men, said: &#8220;Pray, my handsome prince, give me a little
	of what you are eating; I am very hungry.&#8221;</p>

	<p>For answer the prince let fly an arrow from his crossbow,
	but it is impossible to say whether he hit the fox for it vanished
	and did not appear again.</p>

	<p>The second brother, without meeting with any adventure,
	reached a wide-stretching moor, where he stopped for his
	meal. The red fox appeared to him and begged for food;
	but he also refused food to the famished fox, and shot at him.
	The creature disappeared as before.</p>

	<p>The youngest travelled on till he came to the banks of
	a river. Feeling tired and hungry, he got down from his horse
	and began his breakfast; while he was eating, up came the
	red fox.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Please, young sir,&#8221; said the fox, &#8220;give me a morsel to
	satisfy my hunger.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The prince threw him a piece of meat, and spoke kindly
	to him.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Come near, do not be afraid, my red fox; I see you are
	more hungry than I, but there is enough for us both.&#8221;</p>

	<p>And he divided all his provisions into two equal parts,
	one for himself, and one for the poor red fox.</p>

	<p>When the latter had eaten to his heart&#8217;s content, he said:
	<a class="pagenum" id="page274" title="274">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;You have fed me well, in return I will serve you well;
	mount your horse and follow me. If you do everything I tell
	you, the Bird of Fire shall be yours.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then he set off at a run before the horseman, clearing the
	road for him with his bushy tail. By means of this marvellous
	broom, mountains were cut down, ravines filled up, and rivers
	bridged over.</p>

	<p>The young prince followed at a gallop, without the slightest
	wish to stop, until they came to a castle built of copper.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The Bird of Fire is in this castle,&#8221; said the fox; &#8220;you
	must enter exactly at midday, for then the guards will be asleep,
	and you will pass unnoticed. Above all, beware of stopping
	anywhere. In the first apartment you will find twelve birds
	black as night, in golden cages; in the second, twelve golden
	birds in wooden cages; in the third, Ohnivak, the bird of fire,
	roosting on his perch. Near him are two cages, one of
	wood and the other of gold; be sure you put him in the
	wooden cage&#8212;you would be sorry for it if he were put into
	the golden one.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The prince entered the castle, and found everything just
	as the fox had told him. Having passed through the two
	rooms he came to the third, and there saw the fire-bird on
	his perch, apparently asleep. It was indeed a beautiful
	creature, so beautiful that the prince&#8217;s heart beat high with
	joy. He handled him without difficulty, and put him into
	the wooden cage, thinking at the same time to himself that
	it could hardly be right for so lovely a bird to be in such an
	ugly cage, a golden cage could be the only right place for him.
	So he took him out of the wooden cage and placed him in
	the golden one. Hardly had he shut the door when the bird
	<a class="pagenum" id="page275" title="275">&nbsp;</a>opened his eyes and gave a piercing scream; so shrill was it
	that it awoke the other birds, who began to sing as loud as
	they could, and gave the alarm to the guards at the palace
	door. These rushed in, seized the prince, and dragged him
	before the king. The latter was very angry, and said:
	&#8220;Infamous thief, who are you to have dared to force an
	entrance, and pass through my sentinels, to steal my bird
	Ohnivak?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am not a thief,&#8221; answered the young prince indignantly,
	&#8220;I have come to reclaim a thief whom you protect. I am the
	son of a king, and in my father&#8217;s gardens is an apple tree that
	bears golden fruit. It blossoms at morning-time, while during
	the day the flower develops into an apple that grows and
	ripens after sunset. Now in the night your bird robbed us
	of our golden apples, and though I watched and wounded
	him I could not catch him. My father is dying with grief
	because of this, and the only remedy that can save and restore
	him to health, is that he may listen to the fire-bird&#8217;s song.
	This is why I beg your majesty to give him me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You may have him,&#8221; said the king, &#8220;but on one condition,
	that you bring me Zlato-Nrivak, the horse with the
	golden mane.&#8221;</p>

	<p>So the prince had to go away empty-handed.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why did you not do as I told you? Why must you
	go and take the golden cage?&#8221; said the fox, in despair at
	the failure of the expedition.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I admit it was my own fault,&#8221; said the prince, &#8220;but
	do not punish me by being angry. I want your advice: tell
	me how I am to get Zlato-Nrivak?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I know how it can be done,&#8221; answered the red fox,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page276" title="276">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;and I will help you once more. Get on your horse,
	follow me, and do as I tell you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The fox ran on in front, clearing the road with his bushy
	tail. The prince followed at a gallop, until they came to a
	castle built entirely of silver.</p>

	<p>&#8220;In that castle lives the Horse with the Golden Mane,&#8221;
	said the fox. &#8220;You will have to go exactly at midday,
	when the sentinels are asleep; thus you will get past safe
	and sound. But mind, do not stop anywhere. You must
	pass through three stables. In the first are twelve black
	horses with golden bridles; in the second, twelve white
	horses with black bridles; in the third stands Zlato-Nrivak
	in front of his manger, while near him are two bridles, one
	of gold, the other of black leather. Whatever you do, beware
	of using the first, for you will surely repent it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The prince waited until the appointed time and then
	entered the castle, finding everything exactly as the fox had
	said. In the third stable stood Zlato-Nrivak, eating fire that
	flared up out of his silver trough.</p>

	<p>The Horse with the Golden Mane was so beautiful that
	the prince could not take his eyes off him. Quickly unhooking
	the black leather bridle, he put it over the horse&#8217;s head.
	The animal made no resistance, but was gentle and quiet as
	a lamb. Then the prince looked covetously at the golden
	bridle sparkling with gems, and said to himself, &#8220;It is a shame
	that such a splendid creature should be guided by these
	ugly black reins while there is a bridle here far more suited to
	him, and that is indeed his by right.&#8221; So, forgetting his
	late experience and the warnings of the red fox, he tore off
	the black bridle and put in its place that of gold set with
	<a class="pagenum" id="page277" title="277">&nbsp;</a>precious stones. No sooner did the horse feel the change
	than he began to neigh and caper about, while all the other
	horses answered with a perfect storm of neighings. The
	sentinels, aroused by the noise, ran in, and seizing the prince,
	led him before the king.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Insolent thief,&#8221; cried the enraged monarch, &#8220;how is it
	that you have escaped the vigilance of the guards and have
	dared to lay hands upon my horse with the golden mane?
	It is really disgraceful.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;True, I am nothing better,&#8221; replied the prince proudly,
	&#8220;but I was forced to do it against my will.&#8221; And he related
	all his misadventures at the copper castle, adding that it
	was impossible to obtain the fire-bird except in exchange
	for Zlato-Nrivak, and that he hoped his majesty would make
	him a present of the horse.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Most willingly,&#8221; answered the king, &#8220;but on one condition,
	that you bring me the Maiden with the Golden
	Locks: she lives in the golden castle on the shores of the
	Black Sea.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The fox was waiting in the forest the prince&#8217;s return, and
	when he saw him come back without the horse he was very
	angry indeed.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Did I not warn you,&#8221; said he, &#8220;to be content with the
	black leather bridle? It is really a loss of time to try and
	help such an ungrateful fellow, for it seems impossible to
	make you hear reason.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be cross,&#8221; said the prince, &#8220;I confess that I am in
	fault; I ought to have obeyed your orders. But have a little
	more patience with me and help me out of this difficulty.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Very well; but this will certainly be the last time. If
	<a class="pagenum" id="page278" title="278">&nbsp;</a>you do just as you are told we may yet repair all that has
	been spoilt by your imprudence. Mount your horse and
	follow&#8212;off!&#8221;</p>

	<p>The fox ran on in front, clearing the road with his bushy
	tail, until they reached the shores of the Black Sea.</p>

	<p>&#8220;That palace yonder,&#8221; said the fox, &#8220;is the residence of
	the Queen of the Ocean Kingdom. She has three daughters;
	it is the youngest who has the golden hair, and is called Zlato-Vlaska.
	Now you must first go to the queen and ask her to
	give you one of her daughters in marriage. If she takes kindly
	to your proposal she will bid you choose, and mind you take
	that princess who is the most plainly dressed.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The queen received him most graciously, and when he
	explained the object of his visit she led him into a room
	where the three daughters were spinning.</p>

	<p>They were so much alike that no one could possibly
	distinguish one from the other, and they were all so marvellously
	lovely that when the young prince looked upon
	them he dared hardly breathe. Their hair was carefully
	covered by a veil through which one could not distinguish
	the colour of it, but their dresses were different. The first
	wore a gown and veil embroidered with gold, and used a
	golden distaff; the second had on a gown embroidered with
	silver and held a distaff of the same metal; the third wore a
	gown and veil of dazzling whiteness, and her distaff was made
	of wood.</p>

	<p>The mother bade the prince choose, whereupon he pointed
	to the maiden clothed in white, saying, &#8220;Give me this one
	to wife.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said the queen, &#8220;some one has been letting you
	<a class="pagenum" id="page279" title="279">&nbsp;</a>into the secret: but wait a little, we shall meet again to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

	<p>All that night the prince lay awake, wondering how he
	should manage not to make a mistake on the morrow. At
	dawn he was already at the palace gates, which he had
	hardly entered when the princess clothed in white chanced
	to pass: it was Zlato-Vlaska, and she had come to meet him.</p>

	<p>&#8220;If it is your wish to choose me again to-day,&#8221; she said,
	&#8220;observe carefully, and take the maiden around whose head
	buzzes a small fly.&#8221;</p>

	<p>In the afternoon the queen took the prince into a room
	where her three daughters sat, and said: &#8220;If among these
	princesses you recognise the one you chose yesterday she
	shall be yours; if not, you must die.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The young girls stood side by side, dressed alike in costly
	robes, and all had golden hair. The prince was puzzled, and
	their beauty and splendour dazzled him. For some time he
	could hardly see distinctly; then, all of a sudden, a small fly
	buzzed over the head of one of the princesses.</p>

	<p>&#8220;This is the maiden who belongs to me,&#8221; cried he, &#8220;and
	whom I chose yesterday.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The queen, astonished that he should have guessed correctly,
	said, &#8220;Quite right, but I cannot let you have her until
	you have submitted to another trial, which shall be explained
	to you to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

	<p>On the morrow she pointed out to him a large fish-pond
	which lay in the forest, and giving him a small golden sieve,
	said: &#8220;If with this sieve you can, before sunset, empty that
	fish-pond yonder, I will give you my daughter with the golden
	hair, but if you fail you will lose your life.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page280" title="280">&nbsp;</a>The prince took the sieve, and, going down to the pond,
	plunged it in to try his luck; but no sooner had he lifted it
	up than all the water ran out through the holes&#8212;not a drop
	was left behind. Not knowing what to do, he sat down on
	the bank with the sieve in his hand, wondering in what
	possible way the difficulty might be overcome.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why are you so sad?&#8221; asked the maiden in white, as
	she came towards him.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Because I fear you will never be mine,&#8221; sighed he;
	&#8220;your mother has given me an impossible task.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Come, cheer up, away with fear; it will all be right in
	the end.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Thereupon she took the sieve and threw it into the fishpond.
	Instantly the water turned to foam on the surface,
	and a thick vapour rose up, which fell in a fog so dense that
	nothing could be seen through it. Then the prince heard
	footsteps, and turning round saw his horse coming towards
	him, with his bridle down and the red fox at his side.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Mount quickly,&#8221; said the horse, &#8220;there is not a moment
	to lose; lift the maiden in front of you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The faithful steed flew like an arrow, and sped rapidly
	along over the road that had been recently cleared by the
	bushy tail of the red fox. But this time, instead of leading,
	the red fox followed, his tail working marvels as he went: it
	destroyed the bridges, reopened the ravines, raised high mountains,
	and in fact put back everything as it used to be.</p>

	<div class="image"><a class="pagenum disguise" id="page281" title="281">&nbsp;</a>

	</div>

	<p>The prince felt very happy as he rode along, holding the
	Princess with the Golden Hair, but it saddened him much to
	think he would have to give up all thought of marrying her
	himself, and that within a few short hours he must leave her  <!-- Original location of pages 281 & 282 -->
	<a class="pagenum" id="page283" title="283">&nbsp;</a>with the king of the silver palace: the nearer he came to it,
	the more wretched he grew. The red fox, who noticed this,
	said: &#8220;It appears to me that you do not want to exchange
	the lovely Zlato-Vlaska for the Horse with the Golden Mane:
	is it not so? Well, I have helped you so far, I will see what
	I can do for you now.&#8221;</p>

	<p>And having thus spoken he turned a somersault over the
	stump of a fallen tree which lay in the forest: while, to the
	prince&#8217;s amazement, he was immediately transformed into a
	young girl exactly resembling the Princess with the Golden
	Hair.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now, leave your real bride in the forest,&#8221; said the
	transformed fox, &#8220;and take me with you to offer to the
	king of the silver palace in exchange for his horse Zlato-Nrivak.
	Mount the horse, return here, and escape with the
	maid you love; I will manage the rest.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The king of the silver castle received the maiden without
	the least suspicion, and handed over in exchange the Horse
	with the Golden Mane, over whose back lay the bejewelled
	bridle. The prince left at once.</p>

	<p>At the palace all were busy preparing the wedding feast,
	for the marriage was to take place immediately, and everything
	was to be of the most costly description. Invitations
	had been out to all the grandees of the land.</p>

	<p>Towards the end of the feast, when every one had drunk
	his fill of wine and pleasure, the king asked his guests their
	opinions on the charms of his bride.</p>

	<p>&#8220;She is most beautiful,&#8221; said one, &#8220;in fact, it would be
	impossible for her to be more lovely; only, it seems to me
	that her eyes are somewhat like those of a fox.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page284" title="284">&nbsp;</a>The words were hardly out of his mouth when the royal
	bride vanished, while in her place sat a red fox, who with
	one vigorous bound sprang through the door and disappeared
	to rejoin the prince, who had hastened on in front. With
	sweeping strokes of his bushy tail he overthrew bridges,
	reopened precipices, and heaped up mountains; but it was
	very hard work for the poor thing, and he did not come up
	with the runaways until they had almost reached the copper
	castle. Here they all had a rest, while the red fox turned
	a somersault and transformed himself into a horse resembling
	the one with the golden mane. Then the prince entered the
	copper castle and exchanged the transformed fox for the fire-bird
	Ohnivak, the king having no suspicions whatever. The
	red fox, having thus deceived the monarch, reassumed his
	own shape and hurried after the departing prince, whom he
	did not overtake until they had reached the banks of the
	river where they had first become acquainted.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now here you are, prince,&#8221; said the red fox, &#8220;in
	possession of Ohnivak, of the lovely Zlato-Vlaska, and of
	the Horse with the Golden Mane. Henceforth you can
	manage without my help, so return to your father&#8217;s house
	in peace and joy; but, take warning, do not stop anywhere
	on the way, for if you do some misfortune will overtake you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>With these words the red fox vanished, while the prince
	continued his journey unhindered. In his hand he held the
	golden cage that contained the fire-bird, and at his side the
	lovely Zlato-Vlaska rode the Horse with the Golden Mane;
	truly, he was the happiest of men.</p>

	<p>When he reached the cross roads where he had parted
	from his brothers, he hastened to look for the branches they
	<a class="pagenum" id="page285" title="285">&nbsp;</a>had planted. His alone had become a spreading tree, theirs
	were both withered. Delighted with this proof of divine
	favour, he felt a strong desire to rest for a while under the
	shadow of his own tree; he therefore dismounted, and assisting
	the princess to do the same, fastened their horses to
	one of the branches and hung up the cage containing
	Ohnivak on another: within a few moments they were all
	sound asleep.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile the two elder brothers arrived at the same
	place by different roads, and both with empty hands. There
	they found their two branches withered, that of their brother
	having grown into a splendid tree. Under the shade of the
	latter he lay sleeping; by his side was the Maid with the
	Golden Locks; the horse, Zlato-Nrivak, was fastened to a tree,
	and the fire-bird roosted in his golden cage.</p>

	<p>The hearts of the two brothers were filled with envious
	and wicked thoughts, and they whispered thus to one another,
	&#8220;Just think what will become of us&#8212;the youngest will receive
	half of the kingdom during our father&#8217;s life and succeed to the
	throne at his death; why not cut his throat at once? One of
	us will take the Maid with the Golden Locks, the other can
	carry the bird to our father and keep the Horse with the Golden
	Mane; as for the kingdom, we will divide it between us.&#8221;</p>

	<p>After this debate they killed their youngest brother and
	cut up his body into small pieces, while they threatened to
	treat Zlato-Vlaska in the same way if she attempted to disobey
	them.</p>

	<p>On reaching home they sent the Horse with the Golden
	Mane to the marble stables, the cage containing Ohnivak was
	placed in the room where their father lay sick, and the princess
	<a class="pagenum" id="page286" title="286">&nbsp;</a>was allowed a beautiful suite of apartments and maids of
	honour to attend her.</p>

	<p>When the king, who was much weakened by suffering, had
	looked at the bird, he asked after his youngest son. To which
	the brothers replied: &#8220;We have not seen or heard anything
	of him, it is very likely that he has been killed.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The poor old man was much affected&#8212;it seemed, indeed,
	as if his last hour had come. The fire-bird moped and refused
	to sing; the Horse with the Golden Mane stood with his
	head bent down before his manger, and would eat no food;
	while Princess Zlato-Vlaska remained as silent as if she had
	been born dumb, her beautiful hair was neglected and uncombed,
	and she wept&#8212;her tears fell fast.</p>

	<p>Now as the red fox chanced to pass through the forest
	he came upon the mangled body of the youngest brother, and
	he at once set to work to put the scattered pieces together,
	but was unable to restore them to life. At that moment a
	raven, accompanied by two young ones, came hovering overhead.
	The fox crouched behind a bramble bush; and when
	one of the young birds alighted upon the body to feed, he
	seized it and made a pretence of strangling it. Upon which
	the parent bird, full of anxious love and fear, perched upon a
	branch close by and croaked as if to say, &#8220;Let my poor little
	nestling go. I have done you no harm, neither have I worried
	you; let him free, and I will take the first opportunity of
	returning your kindness.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; replied the red fox, &#8220;for I am greatly in need
	of some kindness. Now if you will fetch me some of the
	Water of Death, and some of the Water of Life, from the
	Red Sea, I will let your nestling go safe and sound.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page287" title="287">&nbsp;</a>The old raven promised to fetch the water, and went off
	at once.</p>

	<p>Within three days he returned, carrying in his beak two
	small bottles, one full of the Water of Death, the other of
	the Water of Life. When the red fox received them he
	wished first to try their effect upon some living creature, so
	he cut the small raven up, and joining the pieces together,
	watered them with the Water of Death. Instantly they
	became a living bird, without mark or join anywhere. This
	he sprinkled with the Water of Life, upon which the young
	raven spread its wings and flew off to its family.</p>

	<p>The red fox then performed the same operation on the
	body of the young prince, and with the same happy result,
	for he rose again perfect in form, and having about him no
	wound scars. On coming to life again, all he said was, &#8220;Dear
	me! What a pleasant sleep I have had.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I believe you,&#8221; replied the red fox, &#8220;you would have
	gone on sleeping for ever if I had not awakened you. And
	what a foolish young man you are: did I not particularly
	order you not to stop anywhere, but to go straight back to
	your father&#8217;s house?&#8221;</p>

	<p>He then related all that his brothers had done, and having
	obtained a peasant&#8217;s dress for him, led him to the outskirts of
	the forest, close to the royal palace, where he left him.</p>

	<p>The young prince then entered the palace grounds, unrecognised
	by the servants, and on representing that he was
	in need of employment, was appointed stable-boy to the
	royal stables. Some little time after he heard the grooms
	lamenting that the Horse with the Golden Mane would
	eat no food.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page288" title="288">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;What a pity it is,&#8221; said they, &#8220;that this splendid steed
	should starve to death; he droops his head and will take
	nothing.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Give him,&#8221; said the disguised prince, &#8220;some pea-straw;
	I bet you anything he will eat that.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;But do you really think so? Why, our rough draught
	horses would refuse such coarse food.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The prince&#8217;s only answer was to fetch a bundle of pea-straw,
	which he put into Zlato-Nrivak&#8217;s marble trough: then,
	passing his hand gently over his neck and mane, he said to
	him, &#8220;Grieve no more, my horse with the golden mane.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The beautiful creature recognised his master&#8217;s voice, and
	neighing with joy, greedily devoured the pea-straw.</p>

	<p>The news was noised about from one end of the palace
	to the other, and the sick king summoned the boy to his
	presence.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I hear you have made Zlato-Nrivak eat,&#8221; said his
	majesty; &#8220;do you think you could make my fire-bird sing?
	Go and examine him closely: he is very sad, he droops his
	wings, and will neither eat nor drink. Ah me! if he dies
	I shall certainly die too.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Your majesty may rest assured, the bird will not die.
	Let him have some husks of barley to eat, then he will soon
	be all right and begin to sing.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The king ordered them to be brought, and the disguised
	prince put a handful into Ohnivak&#8217;s cage, saying, &#8220;Cheer
	up, my fire-bird.&#8221;</p>

	<div class="image"><a class="pagenum disguise" id="page289" title="289">&nbsp;</a>
		<a href="images/illo-46.png"><img src="images/illo-46-th.png" width="328" height="499" alt="A king leads a young man into a room where a woman lies on the bed looking depressed." /></a>
		<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page290" title="290">&nbsp;</a>[Blank Page] -->
	</div>

	<p>As soon as Ohnivak heard his master&#8217;s voice he shook
	himself, and made his feathers shine with more than their
	usual brightness. Then he began to dance about his cage,  <!-- Original location of pages 289 & 290 -->
	<a class="pagenum" id="page291" title="291">&nbsp;</a>and pecking up the husks, sang so exquisitely that the
	king immediately felt better, and it was as if a great weight
	had been lifted off his heart. The fire-bird again burst into
	song, and this so affected the king that he sat up quite well,
	and embraced the disguised prince out of very gratitude.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said he, &#8220;teach me how to restore to health
	this beautiful maiden with the golden hair whom my sons
	brought back with them; for she will not speak a word, her
	beautiful hair remains uncared for, and her tears fall night
	and day.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;If your majesty will allow me to speak a few words
	to her, it may be the means of making her bright and
	happy.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The king himself led the way to her apartments, and
	the disguised prince, taking her hand, said: &#8220;Look up a
	moment, sweetheart; why these tears? And why grieve
	thus, dear bride?&#8221;</p>

	<p>The maiden knew him at once, and with a cry of joy
	threw herself into his arms. This astonished the king
	mightily, and he could not for the life of him think how
	a stable-boy dare address such a princess as his &#8220;dear
	bride.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The prince then addressed the king thus: &#8220;And are
	you indeed the only one who does not know me? How
	is it, my father and sovereign, that you have not recognised
	your youngest son? I alone have succeeded in obtaining
	the Fire-Bird, the Horse with the Golden Mane, and the
	Maid with the Golden Hair.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Thereupon he related all his adventures, and Zlato-Vlaska
	in her turn told how the wicked brothers had threatened
	<a class="pagenum" id="page292" title="292">&nbsp;</a>to kill her if she betrayed them. As for these bad men,
	they shook from head to foot, and trembled like leaves
	in the wind. The indignant king ordered them to be
	executed then and there.</p>

	<p>Not very long after these events the youngest prince
	married the beautiful Zlato-Vlaska, and the king gave him
	half of his kingdom as a wedding present. When the old
	king died he reigned in his stead, and lived happily with
	the princess ever after.</p>

	<p class="second_title">TEARS OF PEARLS</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Once</span> upon a time there lived a very rich widow, with
	whom lived three children&#8212;a handsome stepson; his
	sister, who was marvellously beautiful; and her own daughter,
	passably good-looking.</p>

	<p>All three children lived under the same roof, but, as is
	often the case where there are step-parents, they were treated
	very differently. The lady&#8217;s own daughter was bad-tempered,
	disobedient, vain, and of a tell-tale disposition: yet she was
	<a class="pagenum" id="page296" title="296">&nbsp;</a>made much of, praised, and caressed. The step-children
	were treated very harshly: the boy, kind-hearted and obliging,
	was made to do all sorts of hard unpleasant work, was constantly
	scolded, and looked upon as a good-for-nothing. The
	step-daughter, who was not only exceedingly pretty but was
	as sweet as an angel, was found fault with on all occasions,
	and her life made utterly miserable.</p>

	<p>It is, after all, but natural to love one&#8217;s own children
	better than those of others, but the feeling of love should be
	governed by the laws of fairness. Now this wicked woman
	was blind to the faults of the child she loved, and to the good
	qualities of her husband&#8217;s children, whom she hated.</p>

	<p>When in a bad temper she was fond of boasting of the
	handsome fortune she intended securing for her own daughter,
	even though the step-children should be unprovided for. But,
	as the old proverb says, &#8220;Man proposes, but God disposes.&#8221;
	We shall therefore see how things turned out.</p>

	<p>One Sunday morning, before going to church, the step-daughter
	went into the garden to pick some flowers for
	decorating the altar. She had only gathered a few roses when,
	looking up, she saw quite close to her three young men
	robed in dazzling white garments. They sat on a bench
	shaded by shrubs, while near them was an old man who
	asked her for alms.</p>

	<p>She felt rather nervous before the strangers, but when she
	saw the old man she took her last penny from her purse and
	gave it him. He thanked her, and raising his hand over
	the girl&#8217;s head, said to the men: &#8220;This orphan girl is pious,
	patient under misfortune, and kind to the poor, with whom
	she shares the little she has. Tell me what you wish for her.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page297" title="297">&nbsp;</a>The first said, &#8220;I wish that when she weeps her tears
	may be changed into so many pearls.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;And I,&#8221; replied the second, &#8220;that when she smiles sweet
	roses may fall from her lips.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;My wish,&#8221; said the third, &#8220;is that whenever she dips her
	hands into water there shall appear in it shining gold-fish.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;All these gifts shall be hers,&#8221; added the old man. And
	with these words they vanished.</p>

	<p>The maiden was filled with awe, and fell on her knees in
	prayer. Then her heart was filled with joy and peace, and
	she went back into the house. She had scarcely crossed the
	threshold when her stepmother came forward, and looking at
	her sternly, said, &#8220;Well, where have you been?&#8221;</p>

	<p>The poor child began to cry, when&#8212;marvel of marvels&#8212;instead
	of tears, pearls fell from her eyes.</p>

	<p>Notwithstanding her rage, the stepmother picked them up
	as quickly as possible, while the girl smiled as she watched
	her. And as she smiled roses fell from her lips, and her
	stepmother was beside herself with delight.</p>

	<p>The girl then went to put the flowers she had gathered in
	water; and as she dipped her fingers in it while arranging
	them, pretty little gold-fish appeared in the bowl.</p>

	<p>From that day these marvels were constantly occurring;
	the tears were changed into pearls, the smiles scattered roses,
	and the water, even if she dipped but the tips of her fingers
	in, was filled with gold-fish.</p>

	<p>The stepmother softened and became more gentle, while
	little by little she managed to draw from her step-child the
	secret of these gifts.</p>

	<p>So next Sunday morning she sent her own daughter into
	<a class="pagenum" id="page298" title="298">&nbsp;</a>the garden to gather flowers, under pretence of their being for
	the altar. When she had picked a few, she raised her eyes
	and saw the three young men sitting on a low seat, while near
	them stood the little old man with white hair, begging for
	alms. She pretended to be shy before the young men, but
	at the beggar&#8217;s request drew from her pocket a gold piece, and
	gave it him, evidently much against her will. He put it in
	his pocket, and turning to his companions, said: &#8220;This girl
	is the spoilt child of her mother; she is bad-tempered and
	naughty, while her heart is hardened against the poor. It is
	easy to understand why, for the first time in her life, she has
	been so generous to-day. Tell me what gifts you would wish
	me to bestow upon her.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The first said, &#8220;May her tears be changed into lizards.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;And her smile produce hideous toads,&#8221; added the second.</p>

	<p>&#8220;And when her hands touch the water may it be filled
	with serpents,&#8221; said the third.</p>

	<p>&#8220;So let it be,&#8221; cried the old man. And they all vanished.</p>

	<p>The poor girl was terrified, and went back to tell her
	mother what had happened. And it was even so; for if she
	smiled hideous toads fell from her mouth, her tears were
	changed into lizards, and the water in which she dipped but
	the tips of her fingers was filled with serpents.</p>

	<p>The stepmother was in despair, but she only loved her
	child the more, and hated the orphans with a yet more bitter
	hatred. Indeed, she worried them to such an extent that the
	boy determined to put up with it no longer, but to seek his
	fortune elsewhere. So he tied up his belongings in a handkerchief,
	took a loving farewell of his sister, commending her
	to God&#8217;s care, and left his home. The great world lay before
	<a class="pagenum" id="page299" title="299">&nbsp;</a>him, but which path to take he knew not. Turning to the
	cemetery where his parents lay side by side, he wept and
	prayed, kissed the earth that covered them three times, and
	set off on his travels.</p>

	<p>At that moment he felt something hard in the folds of his
	tunic, and pressing on his heart. Wondering what it could
	be, he put in his hand and drew thence a charming portrait
	of his dearly loved sister, surrounded with pearls, roses, and
	gold-fish. So great was his astonishment he could hardly
	believe his eyes. But he was very happy, and kissed the
	picture over and over again; then, with one more look at the
	cemetery, he made the sign of the cross and departed.</p>

	<p>Now a beautiful story is soon told, but the acts of which
	it is the sum pass more slowly.</p>

	<p>After many adventures of little importance he reached the
	capital of a kingdom by the sea, and there obtained the post
	of under-gardener at the royal palace, with good food and
	wages.</p>

	<p>In his prosperity he did not forget his unhappy sister, for
	he felt very uneasy about her. When he had a few moments
	to himself he would sit down in some retired spot and gaze
	upon her portrait with a sad heart and eyes filled with tears.
	For the picture was a faithful likeness of her, and he looked
	upon it as a gift from his parents.</p>

	<p>Now the king had noticed this habit of his, and one day
	while he sat by a stream looking at the picture he came quietly
	behind him, and glanced over his shoulder to see what he was
	so attentively regarding.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Give me that portrait,&#8221; said the monarch.</p>

	<p>The boy handed it him. The king examined it closely,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page300" title="300">&nbsp;</a>and admiring it greatly, said: &#8220;I have never seen such a beautiful
	face in all my life, never even dreamed of such loveliness.
	Come, tell me, is the original of the picture living?&#8221;</p>

	<p>The lad burst into tears, and told him it was the living
	image of his sister, who a short time since had received as
	a special mark of favour from God, that her tears should be
	changed into pearls, her smiles into roses, and the touch of
	her hands in water should produce beautiful gold-fish.</p>

	<p>The king commanded him to write to his stepmother at
	once and bid her send her lovely step-daughter to the chapel
	of the palace, where the king would be waiting to marry her.
	The letter also contained promises of special royal favours.</p>

	<p>The lad wrote the letter, which the king sent by a special
	messenger.</p>

	<p>Now a good story is soon told, but the deeds of which it
	is the sum are not performed so quickly.</p>

	<div class="image"><a class="pagenum disguise" id="page301" title="301">&nbsp;</a>
		<a href="images/illo-48.png"><img src="images/illo-48-th.png" width="307" height="486" alt="An older man looks at a young man looking at a miniature portrait." /></a>
		<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page302" title="302">&nbsp;</a>[Blank Page] -->
	</div>

	<p>When the stepmother received the letter she determined
	to say nothing about it to her step-child, but she showed it
	to her own daughter, and talked the matter over with her.
	Then she went to learn the art of sorcery from a witch, and
	having found out all it was necessary to know, set off with
	both of the girls. On approaching the capital, the wicked
	woman pushed her step-child out of the carriage and repeated
	some magic words over her. After this she became very
	small and covered with feathers, then in a moment she was
	changed into a wild-duck. She began to quack, and made
	for the water, as ducks do, and swam to a far distance. The
	stepmother bade her farewell in the following words: &#8220;By
	the strength of my hate may my will be fulfilled. Swim
	about the banks in the form of a duck, and rejoice in thy  <!-- Original location of pages 301 & 302 -->
	<a class="pagenum" id="page303" title="303">&nbsp;</a>liberty. During that time my daughter shall take thy form,
	shall marry the king, and shall enjoy the good fortune fate
	destined for thee.&#8221;</p>

	<p>At the conclusion of these words her own child became
	endowed with all the graces and beauty of her unfortunate
	step-sister. The two then continued their journey, arriving at
	the royal chapel at the appointed hour. The king received
	them with all honours, while the deceitful woman gave away
	her own daughter, whom the bridegroom believed to be the
	original of the beautiful picture. After the ceremony the
	mother went away loaded with presents. The king, as he
	looked at his young wife, could not understand why he did
	not feel for her the sympathy and admiration he had felt for
	the portrait she so much resembled. But it could not be
	altered now; what is done is done. So he admired her beauty
	and looked forward to the pleasure of seeing pearls fall from
	her eyes, roses from her lips, and gold-fish at the touch of her
	fingers.</p>

	<p>During the wedding feast the newly-made bride forgot
	herself and smiled at her husband; immediately a number of
	hideous toads escaped from her lips. The king, overcome
	with horror and disgust, rushed away from her, upon which
	she began to cry, but instead of pearls, lizards fell from her
	eyes. The majordomo ordered water to be brought for her
	to wash her hands, but no sooner had she dipped the tips of
	her fingers in the bowl than it was filled with serpents that
	hissed and twisted and threw themselves among the wedding
	guests. The panic was general, and a scene of great confusion
	followed. The guard was called in, and had the greatest
	trouble to clear the hall of the disgusting reptiles.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page304" title="304">&nbsp;</a>The bridegroom had taken refuge in the garden, and when
	he saw the young man coming towards him, whom he thought
	had deceived him, his anger overcame him, and he struck the
	poor lad with so much force that he fell down dead.</p>

	<p>The queen ran forward sobbing, and taking the king by
	the hand, said: &#8220;What have you done? You have killed my
	innocent brother. It is neither my fault, nor was it his, that
	since the wedding I have by some enchantment lost the
	marvellous power I possessed before. This evil will pass
	away in time, but time can never restore to me my dear
	brother, my own mother&#8217;s son.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Forgive me, dear wife; in a moment of irritation I
	thought he had deceived me, and I wanted to punish him,
	but did not mean to kill. I regret it deeply, but it cannot be
	helped now. Forgive me my fault as I forgive yours, with all
	my heart.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You have my forgiveness, but I beg you to see that your
	wife&#8217;s brother has an honourable burial.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Her wishes were carried out, and the orphan lad, who had
	passed as her brother, was laid in a handsome coffin. The
	chapel was hung with black, and at night a guard was placed
	both inside and out.</p>

	<p>Towards midnight the church doors silently opened, and
	while the guards were overcome by sleep a pretty little duck
	entered unnoticed. She stopped in the middle of the aisle,
	shook herself, and pulled out her feathers one by one. Then
	it took the form of the beautiful step-daughter, for it was she.
	She went up to her brother&#8217;s coffin and stood gazing at him,
	and as she looked she wept sorrowfully. Then she put on her
	feathers again and went out a duck. When the guards awoke
	<a class="pagenum" id="page305" title="305">&nbsp;</a>they were astonished to find a quantity of fine pearls in the
	coffin. Next day they told the king that the doors had opened
	of themselves towards midnight, that they had been overcome
	by sleep, and that on awakening they had found a large
	number of pearls in the coffin, but knew not how they got
	there. The king was very much surprised, especially at the
	appearance of the pearls, that ought to have been produced
	by his wife&#8217;s tears. On the second night he doubled the
	guard, and impressed upon them the necessity for watchfulness.</p>

	<p>At midnight the doors again opened silently as before, the
	soldiers went to sleep, and the same little duck entered, and,
	taking out her feathers, appeared as a lovely maiden. She
	could not help smiling as she looked upon the sleeping
	soldiers, the number of which had been doubled on her
	account; and as she smiled a number of roses fell from her lips.
	As she drew near her brother her tears fell in torrents, leaving
	a profusion of fine pearls. After some time she put on her
	feathers and went out a duck. When the guards awoke they
	took the roses and the pearls to the king. He was still more
	surprised to see roses with the pearls, for these roses should
	have fallen from his wife&#8217;s lips. He again increased the
	number of the guard, and threatened them with the most
	severe punishment if they failed to watch all night. They
	did their best to obey, but in vain; they could only sleep.
	When they awoke they found, not only roses and pearls, but
	little gold-fish swimming in the holy water.</p>

	<p>The amazed king could only conclude that their sleep
	was caused by magic. On the fourth night he not only increased
	the number of soldiers, but, unknown to every one, hid
	<a class="pagenum" id="page306" title="306">&nbsp;</a>himself behind the altar, where he hung a mirror, through
	which he could see everything that passed without being seen.</p>

	<p>At midnight the doors opened. The soldiers, under the
	influence of sleep, had let fall their arms and lay on the ground.
	The king kept his eyes fixed on the mirror, through which he
	saw a little wild-duck enter. It looked timidly round on all
	sides, then, reassured at the sight of the sleeping guards,
	advanced to the centre of the nave and took off its feathers,
	thus appearing as a young maiden of exquisite beauty.</p>

	<p>The king, overwhelmed with joy and admiration, had a
	presentiment that this was his true bride. So when she drew
	near the coffin he crept noiselessly out of his hiding-place,
	and with a lighted taper set fire to the feathers. They flared
	up immediately, and with such a bright light that the soldiers
	were aroused. The girl ran towards the monarch, wringing
	her hands and weeping tears of pearl.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What have you done?&#8221; cried she. &#8220;How can I now
	escape my stepmother&#8217;s vengeance? For it is by her magic
	that I have been changed into a wild-duck.&#8221;</p>

	<p>When the king had heard all, he ordered some of his
	soldiers to seize the wife he had married and to take her
	right out of the country. He sent others to take the wicked
	stepmother prisoner, and to burn her as a witch. Both commands
	were instantly carried out. Meanwhile the girl drew
	from the folds of her gown three small bottles, filled with
	three different kinds of water, which she had brought from
	the sea.</p>

	<div class="image"><a class="pagenum disguise" id="page307" title="307">&nbsp;</a>
		<a href="images/illo-49.png"><img src="images/illo-49-th.png" width="313" height="493" alt="A young man sets a fire in a chapel." /></a>
		<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page308" title="308">&nbsp;</a>[Blank Page] -->
	</div>

	<p>The first possessed the virtue of restoring life. This she
	sprinkled over her brother, whereupon the chill and rigidity
	of death disappeared, the colour came to his face, and warm  <!-- Original location of pages 307 & 308 -->
	<a class="pagenum" id="page309" title="309">&nbsp;</a>red blood flowed from his wound. Upon the wound she
	poured water from the second bottle, and it was immediately
	healed. When she had made use of the third kind of water
	he opened his eyes, looked at her with astonishment, and
	threw himself joyfully into her arms.</p>

	<p>The king, enraptured at this sight, conducted the two
	back to the palace.</p>

	<p>So instead of a funeral there was a wedding, to which a
	large number of guests were immediately invited. Thus the
	orphan maid was married to the king, while her brother
	became one of his majesty&#8217;s nobles. And the magnificence
	of the wedding feast was greater than anything seen or
	heard of.</p>

	<p class="second_title">THE SLUGGARD</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">On</span> the banks of a certain river, where there was always
	good fishing, lived an old man and his three sons. The
	two eldest were sharp-witted, active young men, already married;
	the youngest was stupid and idle, and a bachelor. When
	the father was dying, he called his children to him and told
	them how he had left his property. The house was for his
	two married sons, with a sum of three hundred florins each.
	After his death he was buried with great pomp, and after
	the funeral there was a splendid feast. All these honours
	were supposed to be for the benefit of the man&#8217;s soul.</p>

	<p>When the elder brothers took possession of their inheritance,
	they said to the youngest: &#8220;Listen, brother; let us take
	<a class="pagenum" id="page314" title="314">&nbsp;</a>charge of your share of the money, for we intend going out
	into the world as merchants, and when we have made a great
	deal of money we will buy you a hat, a sash, and a pair of
	red boots. You will be better at home; and mind you do as
	your sisters-in-law tell you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>For a long time this silly fellow had been wanting a cap,
	a sash, and a pair of red boots, so he was easily persuaded
	to give up all his money.</p>

	<p>The brothers set out on their travels, and crossed the sea
	in search of fortune. The &#8220;fool&#8221; of the family remained
	at home; and, as he was an out-and-out sluggard, he would
	lie whole days at a time on the warm stove without doing a
	stroke of work, and only obeying his sisters-in-law with the
	greatest reluctance. He liked fried onions, potato soup, and
	cider, better than anything else in the world.</p>

	<p>One day his sisters-in-law asked him to fetch them some
	water.</p>

	<p>It was winter, and a hard frost; moreover, the sluggard did
	not feel at all inclined to go out. So he said, &#8220;Go yourselves,
	I prefer to stay here by the fire.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Stupid boy, go at once. We will have some onions,
	potato soup, and cider ready for you when you come back.
	If you refuse to do what we ask you we shall tell our husbands,
	and then there will be neither cap, sash, nor red boots
	for you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>At these words the sluggard thought he had better go.
	So he rolled off the stove, took a hatchet and a couple of
	pails, and went down to the river. On the surface of the
	water, where the ice had been broken, was a large pike. The
	sluggard seized him by the fins and pulled him out.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page315" title="315">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;If you will let me go,&#8221; said the pike, &#8220;I promise to give
	you everything you wish for.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well then, I should like all my desires to be fulfilled the
	moment I utter them.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;You shall have everything you want the moment you
	pronounce these words:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8216;At my behest, and by the orders of the pike,</p>
		<p>May such and such things happen, as I like.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>&#8220;Just wait one moment while I try the effect,&#8221; said the
	sluggard, and began at once to say:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;At my behest, and by the orders of the pike,</p>
		<p>Bring onions, cider, soup, just as I like.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>That very moment his favourite dishes were before him.
	Having eaten a large quantity, he said, &#8220;Very good, very good
	indeed; but will it always be the same?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Always,&#8221; replied the pike.</p>

	<p>The sluggard put the pike back into the river, and turning
	towards his buckets, said:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;At my behest, and by the orders of the pike,</p>
		<p>Walk home yourselves, my pails&#8212;that I should like.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>The pails, and the strong rod to which they were fastened,
	immediately set off and walked solemnly along, the sluggard
	following them with his hands in his pockets. When they
	reached the house he put them in their places, and again
	stretched himself out to enjoy the warmth of the stove.
	Presently the sisters-in-law said, &#8220;Come and chop some wood
	for us.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page316" title="316">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Bother! do it yourselves.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;It is not fit work for women. Besides, if you don&#8217;t do it
	the stove will be cold, and then you will be the chief sufferer.
	Moreover, pay attention to what we say, for if you do not
	obey us, there will be no red boots, nor any other pretty
	things.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The sluggard then just sat up and said:</p>


	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;At my behest, and by the orders of the pike,</p>
		<p>Let what my sisters want be done&#8212;that&#8217;s what I like.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>Instantly the hatchet came out from behind a stool and
	chopped up a large heap of wood, put a part of it on the stove,
	and retired to its corner. All this time the sluggard was
	eating and drinking at his ease.</p>

	<p>Another day some wood had to be brought from the forest.
	Our sluggard now thought he would like to show off before
	the villagers, so he pulled a sledge out of the shed, loaded it
	with onions and soup, after which he pronounced the magic
	words.</p>

	<p>The sledge started off, and passing through the village at
	a rattling pace, ran over several people, and frightened the
	women and children.</p>

	<p>When the forest was reached, our friend looked on while
	the blocks of wood and faggots cut, tied, and laid themselves
	on the sledge, after which they set off home again.
	But when they got to the middle of the village the
	men, who had been hurt and frightened in the morning,
	seized hold of the sluggard and pulled him off the sledge,
	dragging him along by the hair to give him a sound
	thrashing.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page317" title="317">&nbsp;</a>At first he thought it was only a joke, but when the blows
	hurt his shoulders, he said:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;At my behest, and by the orders of the pike,</p>
		<p>Come, faggots, haste, and my assailants strike.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>In a moment all the blocks of wood and faggots jumped
	off the sledge and began to hit right and left, and they hit
	so well that the men were glad to get out of the way as best
	they could.</p>

	<p>The sluggard laughed at them till his sides ached; then
	he remounted his sledge, and was soon lying on the stove
	again.</p>

	<p>From that day he became famous, and his doings were
	talked about all through the country.</p>

	<p>At last even the king heard of him, and, his curiosity
	being aroused, he sent some of his soldiers to fetch him.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now then, booby,&#8221; said the soldier, &#8220;come down off
	that stove and follow me to the king&#8217;s palace.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why should I? There is as much cider, onions, and
	soup as I want at home.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The man, indignant at his want of respect, struck him.</p>

	<p>Upon which the sluggard said:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;At my behest, and by the orders of the pike,</p>
		<p>May this man get a taste of what a broom is like.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>A large broom, and not particularly clean, immediately
	hopped up, and first dipping itself in a pail of water, beat
	the soldier so mercilessly that he was obliged to escape
	through the window, whence he returned to the king. His
	majesty, amazed at the sluggard&#8217;s refusal, sent another
	<a class="pagenum" id="page318" title="318">&nbsp;</a>messenger. This man was &#8217;cuter than his comrade, and
	first made inquiries as to the sluggard&#8217;s tastes. Then he
	went up to him and said, &#8220;Good-day, my friend; will you
	come with me to see the king? He wishes to present you
	with a cap, a waistband, and a pair of red boots.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;With the greatest pleasure; you go on, I will soon
	overtake you.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then he ate as much as he could of his favourite dishes
	and went to sleep on the stove. He slept so long that at
	last his sisters-in-law woke him up and told him he would
	be late if he did not at once go to see the king. The lazy
	fellow said nothing but these words:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;At my behest, and by the orders of the pike,</p>
		<p>This stove to carry me before the king I&#8217;d like.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>At the very same instant the stove moved from its place
	and carried him right up to the palace door. The king was
	filled with amazement, and running out, followed by the
	whole court, asked the sluggard what he would like to have.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I have merely come to fetch the hat, waistband, and
	red boots you promised me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Just then the charming princess Gapiomila came to find
	out what was going on. Directly the sluggard saw her, he
	thought her so enchanting that he whispered to himself:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;At my behest, and by the orders of the pike,</p>
		<p>That this princess so fair may love me, I should like.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>Then he ordered his stove to take him back home, and
	when there he continued to eat onions and soup and to
	drink cider.</p>

	<div class="image"><a class="pagenum disguise" id="page319" title="319">&nbsp;</a>

		<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page320" title="320">&nbsp;</a>[Blank Page] -->
	</div>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page321" title="321">&nbsp;</a>Meanwhile the princess had fallen in love with him, and
	begged her father to send for him again. As the sluggard
	would not consent, the king had him bound when asleep,
	and thus brought to the palace. Then he summoned a
	celebrated magician, who at his orders shut the princess
	and sluggard up in a crystal cask, to which was fastened a
	balloon well filled with gas, and sent it up in the air among
	the clouds. The princess wept bitterly, but the fool sat still
	and said he felt very comfortable. At last she persuaded
	him to exert his powers, so he said:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;At my behest, and by the orders of the pike,</p>
		<p>This cask of crystal earth at once must strike</p>
		<p>Upon the friendly island I should like.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>The crystal cask immediately descended, and opened
	upon a hospitable island where travellers could have all they
	wanted by simply wishing for it. The princess and her
	companion walked about, eating when hungry, and drinking
	when athirst. The sluggard was very happy and contented,
	but the lady begged him to wish for a palace. Instantly the
	palace made its appearance. It was built of white marble,
	with crystal windows, roof of yellow amber, and golden
	furniture. She was delighted with it. Next day she wanted
	a good road made, along which she could go to see her
	father. Immediately there stretched before them a fairy-like
	bridge made of crystal, having golden balustrades set
	with diamonds, and leading right up to the king&#8217;s palace.
	The sluggard was just about to accompany the princess
	when he began to think of his own appearance, and to feel
	ashamed that such an awkward, stupid fellow as he should
	<a class="pagenum" id="page322" title="322">&nbsp;</a>walk by the side of such a lovely and graceful creature.
	So he said:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;At my behest, and by the orders of the pike,</p>
		<p>To be both handsome, wise, and clever I should like.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>Suddenly he became as handsome, wise, and clever as it
	was possible to be. Then he got into a gorgeous carriage
	with Gapiomila, and they drove across the bridge that led
	to the king&#8217;s palace.</p>

	<p>There they were received with every mark of joy and
	affection. The king gave them his blessing, and they were
	married the same evening. An immense number of guests
	were invited to the wedding feast; I, too, was there, and
	drank freely of wine and hydromel. And this is the story I
	have done my best to tell you as faithfully as possible.</p>

	</div>

	<p class="second_title">KINKACH MARTINKO</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Once</span> upon a time there was a poor woman who had
	an only daughter, named Helen, a very lazy girl. One
	day when she had refused to do a single thing, her mother
	took her down to the banks of a stream and began to strike
	her fingers with a flat stone, just as you do in beating linen
	to wash it.</p>

	<p>The girl cried a good deal. A prince, Lord of the Red
	Castle, happened at that moment to pass by, and inquired
	as to the cause of such treatment, for it horrified him that a
	mother should so ill-use her child.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why should I not punish her?&#8221; answered the woman.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page326" title="326">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;The idle girl can do nothing but spin hemp into gold
	thread.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; cried he. &#8220;Does she really know how to spin
	gold thread out of hemp? If that be so, sell her to me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Willingly; how much will you give me for her?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Half a measure of gold.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Take her,&#8221; said the mother; and she gave him her
	daughter as soon as the money was paid.</p>

	<p>The prince placed the girl behind him on the saddle, put
	spurs to his horse, and took her home.</p>

	<p>On reaching the Red Castle, the prince led Helen into a
	room filled from floor to ceiling with hemp, and having supplied
	her with distaff and spinning-wheel, said, &#8220;When you have
	spun all this hemp into gold thread I will make you my wife.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Then he went out, locking the door after him.</p>

	<p>On finding herself a prisoner, the poor girl wept as if her
	heart would break. Suddenly she saw a very odd-looking
	little man seated on the window-sill. He wore a red cap,
	and his boots were made of some strange sort of material.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why do you weep so?&#8221; he asked.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I cannot help it,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;I am but a miserable
	slave. I have been ordered to spin all this hemp into gold
	thread, but it is impossible, I can never do it, and I know
	not what will become of me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I will do it for you in three days, on condition that at
	the end of that time you guess my right name, and tell me
	what the boots I am wearing now are made of.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Without for one moment reflecting as to whether she would
	be able to guess aright she consented. The uncanny little man
	burst out laughing, and taking her distaff set to work at once.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page327" title="327">&nbsp;</a>All day as the distaff moved the hemp grew visibly less,
	while the skein of gold thread became larger and larger.</p>

	<p>The little man spun all the time, and, without stopping
	an instant, explained to Helen how to make thread of pure
	gold. As night drew on he tied up the skein, saying to the
	girl, &#8220;Well, do you know my name yet? Can you tell me
	what my boots are made of?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Helen replied that she could not, upon which he grinned
	and disappeared through the window. She then sat and
	looked at the sky, and thought, and thought, and thought,
	and lost herself in conjecturing as to what the little man&#8217;s
	name might be, and in trying to guess what was the stuff
	his boots were made of. Were they of leather? or perhaps
	plaited rushes? or straw? or cast iron? No, they did not
	look like anything of that sort. And as to his name&#8212;that
	was a still more difficult problem to solve.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What shall I call him?&#8221; said she to herself&#8212;&#8220;John? Or
	Henry? Who knows? perhaps it is Paul or Joseph.&#8221;</p>

	<p>These thoughts so filled her mind that she forgot to eat
	her dinner. Her meditations were interrupted by cries and
	groans from outside, where she saw an old man with white
	hair sitting under the castle wall.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Miserable old man that I am,&#8221; cried he; &#8220;I die of
	hunger and thirst, but no one pities my sufferings.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Helen hastened to give him her dinner, and told him to
	come next day, which he promised to do.</p>

	<p>After again thinking for some time what answers she should
	give the little old man, she fell asleep on the hemp.</p>

	<p>The little old man did not fail to make his appearance the
	first thing next morning, and remained all day spinning the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page328" title="328">&nbsp;</a>gold thread. The work progressed before their eyes, and it
	was only when evening came that he repeated his questions.
	Not receiving a satisfactory answer, he vanished in a fit of
	mocking laughter. Helen sat down by the window to think;
	but think as she might, no answer to these puzzling questions
	occurred to her.</p>

	<p>While thus wondering the hungry old man again came by,
	and she gave him her dinner. She was heart-sick and her
	eyes were full of tears, for she thought she would never guess
	the spinner&#8217;s name, nor of what stuff his boots were made,
	unless perhaps God would help her.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Why are you so sad?&#8221; asked the old man when he had
	eaten and drunk; &#8220;tell me the cause of your grief, dear lady.&#8221;</p>

	<p>For a long time she would not tell him, thinking it would
	be useless; but at last, yielding to his entreaties, she gave a
	full account of the conditions under which the gold thread
	was made, explaining that unless she could answer the little
	old man&#8217;s questions satisfactorily she feared some great misfortune
	would befall her. The old man listened attentively,
	then, nodding his head, he said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;In coming through the forest to-day I passed close to a
	large pile of burning wood, round which were placed nine iron
	pots. A little man in a red cap was running round and
	jumping over them, singing these words:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;My sweet friend, fair Helen, at the Red Castle near,</p>
		<p class="i2">Two days and two nights seeks my name to divine.</p>
		<p>She&#8217;ll never find out, so the third night &#8217;tis clear</p>
		<p class="i2">My sweet friend, fair Helen, can&#8217;t fail to be mine.</p>
		<p>Hurrah! for my name is <strong class="special_name">Kinkach Martinko</strong>,</p>
		<p>Hurrah! for my boots are of doggies&#8217; skin O!&#8221;</p>
	</div>


	<div class="image"><a class="pagenum disguise" id="page329" title="329">&nbsp;</a>

		<!-- <a class="pagenum" id="page330" title="330">&nbsp;</a>[Blank Page] -->
	</div>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page331" title="331">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Now that is exactly what you want to know, my dear
	girl; so do not forget, and you are saved.&#8221;</p>

	<p>And with these words the old man vanished.</p>

	<p>Helen was greatly astonished, but she took care to fix in
	her memory all that the good fellow had told her, and then
	went to sleep, feeling that she could face to-morrow without
	fear.</p>

	<p>On the third day, very early in the morning, the little old
	man appeared and set busily to work, for he knew that all the
	hemp must be spun before sunset, and that then he should
	be able to claim his rights. When evening came all the hemp
	was gone, and the room shone with the brightness of the
	golden thread.</p>

	<p>As soon as his work was done, the queer little old man
	with the red cap drew himself up with a great deal of assurance,
	and with his hands in his pockets strutted up and down
	before Helen, ordering her to tell him his right name and to
	say of what stuff the boots were made: but he felt certain
	that she would not be able to answer aright.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Your name is <strong class="special_name">Kinkach Martinko</strong>, and your boots are
	made of dogskin,&#8221; she replied without the slightest hesitation.</p>

	<p>At these words he spun round on the floor like a bobbin,
	tore out his hair and beat his breast with rage, roaring so that
	the very walls trembled.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It is lucky for you that you have guessed. If you had
	not, I should have torn you to pieces on this very spot:&#8221; so
	saying he rushed out of the window like a whirlwind.</p>

	<p>Helen felt deeply grateful towards the old man who had
	told her the answers, and hoped to be able to thank him in
	person. But he never appeared again.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page332" title="332">&nbsp;</a>The Prince of the Red Castle was very pleased with her
	for having accomplished her task so punctually and perfectly,
	and he married her as he had promised.</p>

	<p>Helen was truly thankful to have escaped the dangers that
	had threatened her, and her happiness as a princess was
	greater than she had dared hope. She had, too, such a good
	stock of gold thread that she never had occasion to spin any
	more all her life long.</p>

	<p class="second_title">THE STORY OF THE PLENTIFUL TABLECLOTH, THE
	AVENGING WAND, THE SASH THAT BECOMES A LAKE, AND THE TERRIBLE HELMET</p>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Now</span> it once happened that one of the king&#8217;s herdsmen
	had three sons. Two of these lads were supposed to be
	very sharp-witted, while the youngest was thought to be very
	stupid indeed. The elder sons helped their father to look
	after the flocks and herds, while the fool, so they called him,
	was good for nothing but sleeping and amusing himself.</p>

	<p>He would pass whole days and nights slumbering peacefully
	on the stove, only getting off when forced to by others,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page336" title="336">&nbsp;</a>or when he was too warm and wished to lie on the other side,
	or when, hungry and thirsty, he wanted food and drink.</p>

	<p>His father had no love for him, and called him a ne&#8217;er-do-well.
	His brothers often tormented him by dragging him off
	the stove, and taking away his food&#8212;indeed, he would many
	a time have gone hungry if his mother had not been good to
	him and fed him on the quiet. She caressed him fondly, for
	why should he suffer, thought she, if he does happen to have
	been born a fool? Besides, who can understand the ways of
	God? It sometimes happens that the wisest men are not
	happy, while the foolish, when harmless and gentle, lead contented
	lives.</p>

	<p>One day, on their return from the fields, the fool&#8217;s two
	brothers dragged him off the stove, and taking him into the
	yard, where they gave him a sound thrashing, they turned him
	out of the house, saying, &#8220;Go, fool, and lose no time, for you
	shall have neither food nor lodging until you bring us a
	basket of mushrooms from the wood.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The poor lad was so taken by surprise he hardly understood
	what his brothers wanted him to do. After pondering
	for a while he made his way towards a small oak forest, where
	everything seemed to have a strange and marvellous appearance,
	so strange that he did not recognise the place. As he
	walked he came to a small dead tree-stump, on the top of
	which he placed his cap, saying, &#8220;Every tree here raises its
	head to the skies and wears a good cap of leaves, but you,
	my poor friend, are bare-headed; you will die of cold. You
	must be among your brothers, as I am among mine&#8212;a born
	fool. Take then my cap.&#8221; And, throwing his arms round
	the dead stump, he wept and embraced it tenderly. At that
	<a class="pagenum" id="page337" title="337">&nbsp;</a>moment an oak which stood near began to walk towards him
	as if it were alive. The poor fellow was frightened, and about
	to run away, but the oak spake like a human being and said,
	&#8220;Do not fly; stop a moment and listen to me. This withered
	tree is my son, and up to this time no one has grieved for his
	dead youth but me. You have now watered him with your
	tears, and in return for your sympathy you shall henceforward
	have anything you ask of me, on pronouncing these words:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;&#8216;O Oak Tree so green, and with acorns of gold,</p>
		<p class="i2">Your friendship to prove I will try;</p>
		<p>In Heaven&#8217;s good name now to beg I&#8217;ll make bold,</p>
		<p class="i2">My needs, then, oh kindly supply.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>At the same moment a shower of golden acorns fell. The
	fool filled his pockets, thanked the oak, and bowing to her
	returned home.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Well, stupid, where are the mushrooms?&#8221; cried one of
	his brothers.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I have some mushrooms off the oak in my pockets.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Eat them yourself then, for you will get nothing else,
	you good-for-nothing. What have you done with your cap?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I put it on a poor stump of a tree that stood by the wayside,
	for its head was uncovered, and I was afraid it might
	freeze.&#8221;</p>

	<p>He then scrambled on to the top of the stove, and as he
	lay down some of the golden acorns fell out of his pocket.
	So bright were they, they shone like sunbeams in the room.
	In spite of the fool&#8217;s entreaties the brothers picked them up
	and gave them to their father, who hastened to present them
	to the king, telling him that his idiot son had gathered them
	<a class="pagenum" id="page338" title="338">&nbsp;</a>in the wood. The king immediately sent a detachment of
	his guards to the forest to find the oak which bore golden
	acorns. But their efforts were fruitless, for, though they
	hunted in every nook and corner of the forest, they found not
	a single oak that bore acorns of gold.</p>

	<div class="image">
		<a href="images/illo-55.png"><img src="images/illo-55-th.png" width="328" height="249" alt="A youth crawls at the foot of a large tree." /></a>
	</div>

	<p>At first the king was very angry, but when he grew calmer
	he sent for his herdsman and said to him, &#8220;Tell your son, the
	fool, that he must bring me, by this evening, a cask filled to the
	brim with these precious golden acorns. If he obeys my commands
	you shall never lack bread and salt, and you may rest
	assured that my royal favour will not fail you in time of need.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page339" title="339">&nbsp;</a>The herdsman gave his youngest son the king&#8217;s message.</p>

	<p>&#8220;The king, I see,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;is fond of a good bargain;
	he does not ask, he commands&#8212;and insists upon a fool
	fetching him acorns of solid gold in return for promises made
	of air. No, I shall not go.&#8221;</p>

	<p>And neither prayers nor threats were of the slightest avail
	to make him change his mind. At last his brothers pulled
	him forcibly off the stove, put his coat on him and a new cap,
	and dragged him into the yard, where they gave him a good
	beating and drove him away, saying, &#8220;Now, you stupid, lose
	no time; be off, and be quick. If you return without the
	golden acorns you shall have neither supper nor bed.&#8221;</p>

	<p>What was the poor fellow to do? For a long time he
	wept, then crossing himself he went in the direction of the
	forest. He soon reached the dead stump, upon which his
	cap still rested, and going up to the mother oak, said to her:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;O Oak Tree so green, and with acorns of gold,</p>
		<p class="i2">In my helplessness I to thee cry;</p>
		<p>In Heaven&#8217;s great name now to beg I make bold,</p>
		<p class="i2">My pressing needs pray satisfy.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>The oak moved, and shook its branches: but instead of
	golden acorns, a tablecloth fell into the fool&#8217;s hands. And
	the tree said, &#8220;Keep this cloth always in your possession, and
	for your own use. When you want a benefit by it, you need
	only say:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;&#8216;O Tablecloth, who for the poor,</p>
		<p class="i2">The hungry, and thirsty, makes cheer,</p>
		<p>May he who begs from door to door</p>
		<p class="i2">Feed off you without stint or fear.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page340" title="340">&nbsp;</a>When it had uttered these words the oak ceased to speak,
	and the fool, thanking her, bowed, and turned towards home.
	On his way he wondered to himself how he should tell his
	brothers, and what they would say, but above all he thought
	how his good mother would rejoice to see the feast-giving
	tablecloth. When he had walked about half the distance he
	met an old beggar who said to him, &#8220;See what a sick and
	ragged old man I am: for the love of God give me a little
	money or some bread.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The fool spread his tablecloth on the grass, and inviting
	the beggar to sit down, said:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;O Tablecloth, who for the poor,</p>
		<p class="i2">The hungry, and thirsty, makes cheer,</p>
		<p>May he who begs from door to door</p>
		<p class="i2">Feed off you without stint or fear.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>Then a whistling was heard in the air, and overhead something
	shone brightly. At the same instant a table, spread as
	for a royal banquet, appeared before them. Upon it were
	many different kinds of food, flasks of mead, and glasses of
	the choicest wine. The plate was of gold and silver.</p>

	<p>The fool and the beggar man crossed themselves and
	began to feast. When they had finished the whistling was
	again heard, and everything vanished. The fool folded up
	his tablecloth and went on his way. But the old man said,
	&#8220;If you will give me your tablecloth you shall have this wand
	in exchange. When you say certain words to it, it will set
	upon the person or persons pointed out, and give them such
	a thrashing, that to get rid of it they will give you anything
	they possess.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page341" title="341">&nbsp;</a>The fool thought of his brothers and exchanged the tablecloth
	for the wand, after which they both went on their
	respective ways.</p>

	<p>Suddenly the fool remembered that the oak had ordered
	him to keep the tablecloth for his own use, and that by parting
	with it he had lost the power of giving his mother an
	agreeable surprise. So he said to the wand:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Thou self-propelling, ever willing, fighting Wand,</p>
		<p class="i4">Run quick and bring</p>
		<p>My feast-providing tablecloth back to my hand,</p>
		<p class="i4">Thy praise I&#8217;ll sing.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>The wand went off like an arrow after the old man,
	quickly overtook him, and throwing itself upon him began to
	beat him dreadfully, crying out in a loud voice:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;For others&#8217; goods you seem to have a liking,</p>
		<p>Stop, thief, or sure your back I&#8217;ll keep on striking.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>The poor beggar tried to run away, but it was of no use,
	for the wand followed him, striking all the time and repeating
	the same words over and over again. So in spite of his
	anxiety to keep the tablecloth he was forced to throw it away
	and flee.</p>

	<p>The wand brought the cloth back to the fool, who again
	went on his way towards home, thinking of the surprise in
	store for his mother and brothers. He had not gone very far
	when a traveller, carrying an empty wallet, accosted him,
	saying, &#8220;For the love of God, give me a small coin or a
	morsel of food, for my bag is empty and I am very hungry.
	I have, too, a long journey before me.&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page342" title="342">&nbsp;</a>The fool again spread his tablecloth on the grass and
	said:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;O Tablecloth, who for the poor,</p>
		<p class="i2">The hungry, and thirsty, makes cheer,</p>
		<p>May he who begs from door to door</p>
		<p class="i2">Feed off you without stint or fear.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>A whistling was heard in the air, something shone brightly
	overhead, and a table, spread as for a royal feast, placed itself
	before them. It was laid with a numerous variety of dishes,
	hydromel and costly wines. The fool and his guest sat down,
	crossed themselves, and ate to their hearts&#8217; content. When
	they had finished whistling was again heard, and everything
	vanished. The fool folded the cloth up carefully, and was
	about to continue his journey when the traveller said, &#8220;Will
	you exchange your tablecloth for my waistband? When you
	say to it certain words it will turn into a deep lake, upon
	which you may float at will. The words run thus:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;&#8216;O marvellous, wonderful, lake-forming Band,</p>
		<p class="i2">For my safety, and not for my fun,</p>
		<p>Bear me in a boat on thy waves far from land,</p>
		<p class="i2">So that I from my foes need not run.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>The fool thought his father would find it very convenient
	always to have water at hand for the king&#8217;s flocks, so he gave
	his tablecloth in exchange for the belt, which he wound round
	his loins, and taking the wand in his hand, they went off in
	opposite directions. After a little while the fool began to
	reflect on what the oak had told him about keeping the tablecloth
	for his own use, and he remembered, too, that he
	was depriving himself of the power of giving his mother a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page343" title="343">&nbsp;</a>pleasant surprise. Thereupon he said the magic words to
	his wand:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Thou self-propelling, ever willing, fighting Wand,</p>
		<p class="i4">Run quick and bring</p>
		<p>My feast-providing tablecloth back to my hand,</p>
		<p class="i4">Thy praise I&#8217;ll sing.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>The wand at once started in pursuit of the poor traveller,
	whom it began to beat, at the same time crying out:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;For others&#8217; goods you seem to have a liking,</p>
		<p>Stop, thief, or sure your back I&#8217;ll keep on striking.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>The man was scared out of his wits, and tried to escape
	the wand&#8217;s blows, but it was of no use, so he was forced to
	throw the tablecloth away and run at the top of his speed.
	The wand brought the tablecloth back to his master. The
	latter hid it under his coat, rearranged the waistband, and
	taking the faithful wand in his hand, again went towards home.
	As he walked he rejoiced to think of the pleasure he should
	have in exercising the wand on his wicked brothers, of his
	father&#8217;s satisfaction when, by the help of the waistband, he
	could always have water for the king&#8217;s flocks, even in the
	driest weather, and of his mother&#8217;s joy on witnessing the
	wonders of the feast-giving tablecloth. These pleasant
	thoughts were interrupted by a soldier, lame, clothed in rags,
	and covered with wounds. He had once been a famous
	warrior.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I am pursued by misfortunes,&#8221; said he to the fool. &#8220;I
	was once a brave soldier, and fought valiantly in my youth.
	Now I am lamed for life, and on this lonely road have found
	<a class="pagenum" id="page344" title="344">&nbsp;</a>no one to give me a morsel of food. Have pity on me and
	give me a little bread.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The fool sat down on the grass, and spreading out his
	tablecloth, said:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;O Tablecloth, who for the poor,</p>
		<p class="i2">The hungry, and thirsty, makes cheer,</p>
		<p>May he who begs from door to door</p>
		<p class="i2">Feed off you without stint or fear.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>A whistling was heard in the air, something bright shone
	overhead, and then before them stood a table, spread as for
	a royal feast, loaded with dainty dishes, mead, and costly
	wines. When they had eaten and drunk as much as they
	wanted the whistling was again heard, and then everything
	vanished.</p>

	<p>The fool was folding up his tablecloth, when the soldier
	said:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Will you give me your tablecloth in exchange for this
	six-horned helmet? It will fire itself off and instantly destroy
	the object pointed out. You have but to turn it round on
	your head and repeat these words:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;&#8216;O Magic Helmet, never thou</p>
		<p class="i2">Dost want for powder nor shot;</p>
		<p>Allay my fears and fire now</p>
		<p class="i2">Just where I point. Fail not.&#8217;</p>
	</div>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">You will see that it fires off immediately: and even if your
	enemy were a mile away he would fall.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The fool was delighted with the idea, and thought how
	useful such a hat would be in any sudden danger; it would
	even serve him to defend his country, the king, or himself.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page345" title="345">&nbsp;</a>So he handed the tablecloth to the soldier, put the helmet
	on his head, took his wand in his hand, and again set his face
	towards home.</p>

	<p>When he had gone some distance, and the soldier was
	almost out of sight, he began to think of what the oak had
	said about not parting with the tablecloth, and of how his
	dear mother could not now enjoy the pleasant surprise he
	had been dreaming about. So he said to the wand:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Thou self-propelling, ever willing, fighting Wand,</p>
		<p class="i4">Run quick, and bring</p>
		<p>My feast-providing tablecloth back to my hand,</p>
		<p class="i4">Thy praise I&#8217;ll sing.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>The wand dashed after the soldier, and having reached
	him began to beat him, crying out:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;For others&#8217; goods you seem to have a liking,</p>
		<p>Stop, thief, or sure your back I&#8217;ll keep on striking.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>The soldier was still a powerful man, and in spite of his
	wound turned right about face, intending to give blow for
	blow. But the wand was too much for him, and he soon
	found resistance useless. So, overcome by pain rather than
	fear, he threw away the tablecloth and took to his heels.</p>

	<p>The faithful wand brought the tablecloth back to his
	master, who, glad to have it again, once more turned towards
	home.</p>

	<p>He soon left the forest, crossed the fields, and came in
	sight of his father&#8217;s house. At a little distance therefrom his
	brothers met him, and said crossly, &#8220;Well, stupid, where are
	the golden acorns?&#8221;</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page346" title="346">&nbsp;</a>The fool looked at them and laughed in their faces.
	Then he said to his wand:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;O self-propelling, ever willing, fighting Wand</p>
		<p class="i4">Strike with thy usual fire</p>
		<p>My ever-scolding, teasing, worrying brother band,</p>
		<p class="i4">For they have roused my ire.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>The wand needed no second bidding, and darting out of
	his hand began to thrash the brothers soundly, crying out like
	a reasoning creature:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Your brother has often your blows felt, alack!</p>
		<p>Now taste it yourselves; hope you like it, whack, whack.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>The brothers were overpowered, and felt all the while as if
	boiling water were being poured over their heads. Yelling
	with pain they began to run at full speed, and soon disappeared
	with clouds of dust flying round them.</p>

	<p>The wand then came back to the fool&#8217;s hand. He went
	into the house, climbed on the stove, and told his mother all
	that had happened. Then he cried:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;O Tablecloth, who for the poor,</p>
		<p class="i2">The hungry, and thirsty, makes cheer,</p>
		<p>Let us within our cottage door</p>
		<p class="i2">Feed off you without stint or fear.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>A whistling was heard in the air, something bright shone
	overhead, and then a table, laid as for a royal banquet, was
	placed before them, covered with dainty meats, glasses, and
	bottles of mead and wine. The whole service was of gold
	and silver. As the fool and his mother were about to begin
	the feast the herdsman entered. He stopped, dumb with
	<a class="pagenum" id="page347" title="347">&nbsp;</a>amazement, but when invited to partake, began to eat and
	drink with great enjoyment.</p>

	<p>At the end of the meal the whistling was again heard, and
	everything vanished completely.</p>

	<p>The herdsman set off in hot haste to the court, to tell the
	king of this new marvel. Thereupon his majesty sent one of
	his heroes in search of the fool, whom he found stretched on
	the stove.</p>

	<p>&#8220;If you value your life, listen, and obey the king&#8217;s orders,&#8221;
	said the paladin. &#8220;He commands you to send him by me
	your tablecloth, then you shall have your share of his royal
	favour. But if not you will always remain a poor fool, and
	will, moreover, be treated as a refractory prisoner. We teach
	them how to behave; you understand?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh yes, I understand.&#8221; And then he pronounced the
	magic words:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;O self-propelling, ever willing, fighting Wand,</p>
		<p class="i4">Go, soundly thrash that man&#8212;</p>
		<p>The most deceiving, dangerous wretch in all the land,</p>
		<p class="i4">So hurt him all you can.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>The wand sprang from the fool&#8217;s hand with the speed of
	lightning and struck the paladin three times in the face. He
	immediately fled, but the wand was after him, hitting him all
	the time, and crying out:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;Mere promises are children&#8217;s play,</p>
		<p>So do not throw your breath away,</p>
		<p>But think of something true to say,</p>
		<p>You rogue, when next you come our way.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>Defeated and filled with consternation, the paladin returned
	<a class="pagenum" id="page348" title="348">&nbsp;</a>to the king and told him about the wand, and how badly
	he had been beaten. When the king heard that the fool
	possessed a wand that struck of itself, he wanted it so much
	that for a time he forgot all about the tablecloth, and
	sent some of his soldiers with orders to bring him back
	the wand.</p>

	<p>When they entered the cottage, the fool, as usual, was
	lying on the stove.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Deliver up the wand to us instantly,&#8221; said they; &#8220;the
	king is willing to pay any price you ask, but if you refuse he
	will take it from you by force.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Instead of replying the fool unwound the waistband, saying
	to it as he did so:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;O marvellous, wonderful, lake-forming Band,</p>
		<p class="i2">For my safety, and not for my fun,</p>
		<p>Bear me in a boat on thy waves far from land,</p>
		<p class="i2">So that I from my foes need not run.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>There was a shimmering in the air, while at the same
	moment everything around them disappeared, and a beautiful
	lake, long, wide, and deep, was seen, surrounded by green
	fields. Fish with golden scales and eyes of pearls played in
	the clear water. In the centre, in a small silver skiff, rowed
	a man, whom the soldiers recognised as the fool.</p>

	<p>They remained some time looking at this miracle, and
	then ran off to tell the king. Now when the king heard
	thereof he was so anxious to possess the lake, or rather the
	waistband that produced the lake, that he sent a whole
	battalion of soldiers to take the fool prisoner.</p>

	<p>This time they managed to get hold of him while he was
	<a class="pagenum" id="page349" title="349">&nbsp;</a>asleep, but as they were about to tie his hands he turned his
	hat round and said:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;O Magic Helmet, never thou</p>
		<p class="i2">Dost want for powder nor shot,</p>
		<p>Allay my fears and fire now</p>
		<p class="i2">Just where I point. Fail not.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>Instantly a hundred bullets whistled through the air, amid
	clouds of smoke and loud reports. Many of the soldiers fell
	dead, others took refuge in the wood, whence they returned
	to the king to give an account of what had taken place.</p>

	<p>Whereupon the king flew into a violent rage, furious that
	he had as yet failed to take the fool. But his wish to possess
	the feast-giving tablecloth, the magic wand, the lake-forming
	sash, and above all the helmet with twenty-four horns, was
	stronger than ever.</p>

	<p>Having reflected for some days on the best ways and
	means to attain his object, he resolved to try the effect of
	kindness, and sent for the fool&#8217;s mother.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Tell your son, the fool,&#8221; said his majesty to the woman,
	&#8220;that my charming daughter and I send greeting, and that we
	shall consider it an honour if he will come here and show us
	the marvellous things he possesses. Should he feel inclined
	to make me a present of them, I will give him half my kingdom
	and will make him my heir. You may also say that the
	princess, my daughter, will choose him for her husband.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The good woman hastened home to her son, whom she
	advised to accept the king&#8217;s invitation and show him his
	treasures. The fool wound the waistband round his loins,
	put the helmet on his head, hid the tablecloth in his breast,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page350" title="350">&nbsp;</a>took his magic wand in his hand, and started off to go to the
	court.</p>

	<p>The king was not there on his arrival, but he was received
	by the paladin, who saluted him courteously. Music played,
	and the troops did him military honours&#8212;in fact, he was
	treated far better than he had expected. On being presented
	to the king he took off his helmet, and bowing low, said: &#8220;O
	king, I am come to lay at the foot of your throne my tablecloth,
	waistband, wand, and helmet. In return for these
	gifts I beg that your favour may be shown to the most humble
	of your subjects.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Tell me then, fool, what price you want for these
	goods?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Not money, sire, a fool of my sort cares very little about
	money. Has not the king promised my mother that he will
	give me in exchange the half of his kingdom, and the hand of
	his daughter in marriage? These are the gifts I claim.&#8221;</p>

	<p>After these words the paladin was filled with envy at the
	good fortune of the fool, and made a sign for the guards to
	enter. The soldiers seized the poor fellow, dragged him out
	into the courtyard, and they killed him treacherously to the
	sound of drums and trumpets, after which they covered him
	over with earth.</p>

	<p>Now it happened that when the soldiers stabbed him his
	blood spurted out, and some of the drops fell beneath the
	princess&#8217;s window. The maiden wept bitterly at the sight,
	watering the blood-stained ground with her tears. And lo!
	marvellous to relate, an apple-tree grew out of the blood-sprinkled
	earth. And it grew so rapidly that its branches
	soon touched the windows of her rooms; by noon it was
	<a class="pagenum" id="page351" title="351">&nbsp;</a>covered with blossom, while at eventide ripe red apples hung
	thereon. As the princess was admiring them she noticed that
	one of the apples trembled, and when she touched it, it fell
	into the bosom of her dress. This took her fancy, and she
	held it in her hand.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile the sun had set, night had fallen, and every one
	in the palace was asleep, except the guard, the paladin, and
	the princess. The guard, sword in hand, patrolled up and
	down, for it was his duty. The princess toyed with her pretty
	little apple, and could not sleep. The paladin, who had gone
	to bed, was aroused by a sound that made his blood run cold,
	for the avenging wand stood before him and began to beat
	him soundly. And although he rushed from the room trying
	to escape from it, it followed him, crying out:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;False paladin, you worthless man,</p>
		<p class="i2">Do not so envious be;</p>
		<p>Why act unjustly, when you can</p>
		<p class="i2">Both just and honest be?</p>
		<p>For others&#8217; goods why have you such a liking?</p>
		<p>You rogue, you thief, be sure I&#8217;ll keep on striking.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>The unhappy man wept and cried for mercy, but the wand
	still continued to strike.</p>

	<p>The princess was distressed on hearing these cries of
	distress, and she watered her much-cherished apple with
	her tears. And, strange to tell, the apple grew and changed
	its shape. Thus continuing to change, it suddenly turned
	into a handsome young man, even the very same who had
	been killed that morning.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Lovely princess, I salute you,&#8221; said the fool. &#8220;The
	cunning of the paladin caused my death, but with your tears
	<a class="pagenum" id="page352" title="352">&nbsp;</a>you have restored me to life. Your father promised to give
	you to me: are you willing?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;If such be the king&#8217;s wish, I consent,&#8221; replied she, as she
	gave him her hand with a tender look.</p>

	<p>As he spoke the door opened, admitting the helmet, which
	placed itself upon his head; the sash, which wound itself
	round his waist; the tablecloth, which hid itself in one of
	his pockets; and the avenging wand, which placed itself in
	his hand. Then came the king, all out of breath, and
	wondering what the noise was about. He was amazed to
	see the fool alive again, and even more so that he should
	be with the princess.</p>

	<p>The young fellow, fearing the king&#8217;s wrath, cried out:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>&#8220;O marvellous, wonderful, lake-forming Band,</p>
		<p class="i2">For my safety, and not for my fun,</p>
		<p>Bear us in a boat on thy waves far from land,</p>
		<p class="i2">So that we from our foes need not run.&#8221;</p>
	</div>

	<p>There was a shimmering in the air, and then everything
	disappeared, while on the lawn before the palace stretched
	a wide deep lake, in the crystal water of which swam little
	fish with eyes of pearl and scales of gold. Far away rowed
	the princess and the fool in a silver skiff. The king stood
	on the shores of the lake and signed to them to return.
	When they had landed they knelt at his feet and avowed
	their mutual love. Upon which his majesty bestowed his
	blessing, the lake disappeared, and they again found themselves
	in the princess&#8217;s apartments.</p>

	<p>The king called a special meeting of his council, at which
	he explained how things had turned out&#8212;that he had made
	<a class="pagenum" id="page353" title="353">&nbsp;</a>the fool his heir, and betrothed him to his daughter, and had
	put the paladin in prison.</p>

	<p>The fool gave the king his magic treasures, and told him
	what words to say in each case.</p>

	<p>Next day all their wishes were fulfilled. The fool of the
	family was married to the princess, and at the same time
	received half the kingdom, with the promise of succession
	to the throne. And the wedding feast, to which all the
	rich and noble of the land were invited, exceeded in its
	magnificence and splendour any other festival ever seen or
	heard of.</p>
